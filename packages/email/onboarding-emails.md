These emails have good bones but yeah, they have that ChatGPT sheen. The structure is too neat, the bullet points feel mechanical, and phrases like "really opens up" and "usually clicks" are dead giveaways.

Here's my pass at them:

---

**Email 1 - Welcome (Day 0)**

Subject: You're in

Hi,

Thanks for trying OpenPanel.

We built OpenPanel because most analytics tools are either too expensive, too complicated, or both. OpenPanel is different.

If you already have setup your tracking you should see your dashboard getting filled up. If you come from another provider and want to import your old events you can do that in our project settings. 

If you can't find your provider just reach out and we'll help you out.

Reach out if you have any questions. I answer all emails.

**Email 2 - What to track (Day 2)**

Subject: What's actually worth tracking

Hi,

Track the moments that tell you whether your product is working. Track things that matters to your product the most and then you can easily create funnels or conversions reports to understand what happening.

For most products, that's something like:
- Signups
- The first meaningful action (create something, send something, buy something)
- Return visits

You don't need 50 events. Five good ones will tell you more than fifty random ones.

If you're not sure whether something's worth tracking, just ask. I'm happy to look at your setup.

**Email 3 - Dashboards (Day 6)**

Subject: The part most people skip

Hi,

Tracking events is the easy part. The value comes from actually looking at them.

If you haven't yet, try building a simple dashboard. Pick one thing you care about and visualize it. Could be:

- How many people sign up and then actually do something
- Where users drop off in a flow (funnel)
- Which pages lead to conversions (entry page -> CTA)

This is usually when people go from "I have analytics" to "I understand what's happening." It's a different feeling.

Takes maybe 10 minutes to set up. Worth it.

**Email 4 - Replace the stack (Day 14)**

Subject: One provider to rule them all

Hi,

A lot of people who sign up are using multiple tools: something for traffic, something for product analytics and something else for seeing raw events.

OpenPanel can replace that whole setup.

If you're still thinking of web analytics and product analytics as separate things, try combining them in a single dashboard. Traffic sources on top, user behavior below. That view tends to be more useful than either one alone.

OpenPanel should be able to replace all of them, you can just reach out if you feel like something is missing.

**Email 5 - Trial ending (Day 26)**

Subject: Your trial ends in a few days

Hi,

Quick heads up: your OpenPanel trial ends soon.

Your tracking will keep working, but you won't be able to see new data until you upgrade. Everything you've built so far (dashboards, reports, event history) stays intact.

If OpenPanel has been useful, upgrading just keeps it going. Plans start at $2.50/month and based on your usage we recommend {xxxx}.

If something's holding you back, I'd like to hear about it. Just reply.

Your project will receive events for the next 30 days, if you haven't upgraded by then we'll remove your workspace and projects.
