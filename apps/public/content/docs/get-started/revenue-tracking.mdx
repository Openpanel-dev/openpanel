Revenue tracking is a great way to get a better understanding of what your best revenue source is. On this page we'll break down how to get started.

Before we start, we need to know some fundamentals about how OpenPanel and your payment provider work and how we can link a payment to a visitor.

### Payment providers

Usually, you create your checkout from your backend, which then returns a payment link that your visitor will be redirected to. When creating the checkout link, you usually add additional fields such as metadata, customer information, or order details. We'll add the device ID information in this metadata field to be able to link your payment to a visitor.

### OpenPanel

OpenPanel is a cookieless analytics tool that identifies visitors using a `device_id`. To link a payment to a visitor, you need to capture their `device_id` before they complete checkout. This `device_id` will be stored in your payment provider's metadata, and when the payment webhook arrives, you'll use it to associate the revenue with the correct visitor.

## Some typical flows

- [Revenue tracking from your frontend](#revenue-tracking-from-your-frontend)

### Revenue tracking from your backend (webhook)

This is the most common flow and most secure one. Your backend receives webhooks from your payment provider, and here is the best opportunity to do revenue tracking. 

<FlowStep step={1} actor="Visitor" description="Visits your website" icon="visitor" />

<FlowStep step={2} actor="Visitor" description="Makes a purchase" icon="visitor" />

<FlowStep step={3} actor="Your website" description="Does a POST request to get the checkout URL" icon="website">
When you create the checkout, you should first call `op.getDeviceId()`, which will return your visitor's current `deviceId`. Pass this to your checkout endpoint.

```javascript
fetch('https://domain.com/api/checkout', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    deviceId: await op.getDeviceId(), // ✅ since deviceId is here we can link the payment now
    // ... other checkout data
  }),
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Handle checkout response, e.g., redirect to payment link
    window.location.href = data.paymentUrl;
  })
```
</FlowStep>

<FlowStep step={4} actor="Your backend" description="Will generate and return the checkout URL" icon="backend">
```javascript
import Stripe from 'stripe';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { deviceId, amount, currency } = await req.json();
  
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    line_items: [
      {
        price_data: {
          currency: currency,
          product_data: { name: 'Product Name' },
          unit_amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
        },
        quantity: 1,
      },
    ],
    mode: 'payment',
    metadata: {
      deviceId: deviceId, // ✅ since deviceId is here we can link the payment now
    },
    success_url: 'https://domain.com/success',
    cancel_url: 'https://domain.com/cancel',
  });
  
  return Response.json({
    paymentUrl: session.url,
  });
} 
```
</FlowStep>

<FlowStep step={5} actor="Visitor" description="Gets redirected to payment link" icon="visitor" />

<FlowStep step={6} actor="Visitor" description="Pays on your payment provider" icon="payment" />

<FlowStep step={7} actor="Your backend" description="Receives a webhook for a successful payment" icon="backend">
```javascript
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const event = await req.json();
  
  // Stripe sends events with type and data.object structure
  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    const session = event.data.object;
    const deviceId = session.metadata.deviceId;
    const amount = session.amount_total;
    
    op.revenue(amount, { deviceId }); // ✅ since deviceId is here we can link the payment now
  }
  
  return Response.json({ received: true });
}
```
</FlowStep>

<FlowStep step={8} actor="Visitor" description="Redirected to your website with payment confirmation" icon="success" isLast />

### Revenue tracking from your frontend

This flow tracks revenue directly from your frontend. Since the success page doesn't have access to the payment amount (payment happens on Stripe's side), we track revenue when checkout is initiated and then confirm it on the success page.

<FlowStep step={1} actor="Visitor" description="Visits your website" icon="visitor" />

<FlowStep step={2} actor="Visitor" description="Clicks to purchase" icon="visitor" />

<FlowStep step={3} actor="Your website" description="Track revenue when checkout is initiated" icon="website">
When the visitor clicks the checkout button, track the revenue with the amount.

```javascript
async function handleCheckout() {
  const amount = 2000; // Amount in cents

  // Create a pending revenue
  op.revenue.pending(amount)
   
  // Redirect to Stripe checkout
  window.location.href = 'https://checkout.stripe.com/...';
}
```
</FlowStep>

<FlowStep step={4} actor="Visitor" description="Gets redirected to payment link" icon="visitor" />

<FlowStep step={5} actor="Visitor" description="Pays on your payment provider" icon="payment" />

<FlowStep step={6} actor="Visitor" description="Redirected back to your success page" icon="visitor" />

<FlowStep step={7} actor="Your website" description="Confirm/flush the revenue on success page" icon="website" isLast>
On your success page, you just flush the pending revenue events

```javascript
op.revenue.flush()
```
</FlowStep>

#### Pros:
- Quick way to get going
- No backend required
- Can track revenue immediately when checkout starts

#### Cons:
- Less accurate (visitor might not complete payment)
- Less "secure" meaning anyone could post revenue data

## Available methods

### Revenue 

The revenue method will create a revenue event. It's important to know that this method will not work if your OpenPanel instance didn't recieve a client secret (for securuty reasons). You can enable frontend revenue tracking within your project settings.

```javascript
op.revenue(amount: number, properties: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void>
```

### Add a pending revenue

This method will create a pending revenue item and will not be sent to us until your have called [flush](#send-all-pending-revenues)

```javascript
op.revenue.pending(amount: number, properties: Record<string, unknown>): void
```

### Send all pending revenues

This method will send all pending revenues to OpenPanel to be stored

```javascript
op.revenue.flush(): Promise<void>
```

### Clear any pending revenue

This method will just clear any pending revenues.

```javascript
op.revenue.clear(): void
```
