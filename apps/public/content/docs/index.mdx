track('your_event_name', {
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: 'qux',
  // reserved property name
  __identify: {
    profileId: 'your_user_id', // required
    email: 'your_user_email',
    firstName: 'your_user_name',
    lastName: 'your_user_name',
    avatar: 'your_user_avatar',
  }
});
```

### Identify

Associates the current user with a unique identifier and optional traits.

### Increment
