As of version 0.0.5, we have removed Clerk.com from OpenPanel. This means that if you are upgrading from a previous version, you will need to export your users from Clerk and import them into OpenPanel. Here is how you can do it.

Before we start lets get the users from Clerk. Go to **Clerk > Configure > Settings > Export all users** and download the CSV file. This file will be used to import the users into OpenPanel.



<Steps>
<Step>
Copy the csv file we downloaded from Clerk to your server:
```bash
scp ./path/to/your/clerk-users.csv user@your-ip:users-dump.csv
```
</Step>
<Step>
SSH into your server:
```bash
ssh user@your-ip
```
</Step>
<Step>
Pull the latest images, and restart the containers:
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```
</Step>
<Step>
SSH into your server:
```bash
ssh user@your-ip
```
</Step>
<Step>
Run the following command to copy the file to the OpenPanel container:
```bash
docker compose cp ./users-dump.csv op-api:/app/packages/db/code-migrations/users-dump.csv
```
</Step>
<Step>
Run the migration:
```bash
docker compose exec -it op-api bash -c "cd /app/packages/db && pnpm migrate:deploy:db:code 2-accounts.ts"
```
</Step>
</Steps>
