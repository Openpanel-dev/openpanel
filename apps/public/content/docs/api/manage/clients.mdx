title: Clients
description: Manage API clients for your OpenPanel projects. Create, read, update, and delete clients with different access levels.
---

## Authentication

To authenticate with the Clients API, you need to use your `clientId` and `clientSecret` from a root client. Root clients have organization-wide access.

For detailed authentication information, see the [Authentication](/docs/api/authentication) guide.

Include the following headers with your requests:
- `openpanel-client-id`: Your OpenPanel root client ID
- `openpanel-client-secret`: Your OpenPanel root client secret

## Base URL

All Clients API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.openpanel.dev/manage/clients
```

## Client Types

OpenPanel supports three client types with different access levels:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `read` | Read-only access | Export data, view insights, read-only operations |
| `write` | Write access | Track events, send data to OpenPanel |
| `root` | Full access | Manage resources, access Manage API |

**Note**: Only `root` clients can access the Manage API.

## Endpoints

### List Clients

Retrieve all clients in your organization, optionally filtered by project.

```
GET /manage/clients
```

#### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `projectId` | string | Optional. Filter clients by project ID |

#### Example Request

```bash
# List all clients
curl 'https://api.openpanel.dev/manage/clients' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-id: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_ID' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-secret: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET'

# List clients for a specific project
curl 'https://api.openpanel.dev/manage/clients?projectId=my-project' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-id: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_ID' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-secret: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "fa0c2780-55f2-4d9e-bea0-da2e02c7b1a9",
      "name": "First client",
      "type": "write",
      "projectId": "my-project",

    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: Client secrets are never returned in list or get responses for security reasons.

### Get Client

Retrieve a specific client by ID.

```
GET /manage/clients/{id}
```

#### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | The ID of the client (UUID) |

#### Example Request

```bash
curl 'https://api.openpanel.dev/manage/clients/fa0c2780-55f2-4d9e-bea0-da2e02c7b1a9' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-id: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_ID' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-secret: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "fa0c2780-55f2-4d9e-bea0-da2e02c7b1a9",
    "name": "First client",
    "type": "write",
    "projectId": "my-project",
    "organizationId": "org_123",
    "ignoreCorsAndSecret": false,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Create Client

Create a new API client. A secure secret is automatically generated and returned once.

```
POST /manage/clients
```

#### Request Body

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Client name (minimum 1 character) |
| `projectId` | string | No | Associate client with a specific project |
| `type` | string | No | Client type: `read`, `write`, or `root` (default: `write`) |

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.openpanel.dev/manage/clients' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-id: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_ID' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-secret: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My API Client",
    "projectId": "my-project",
    "type": "read"
  }'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "b8904453-863d-4e04-8ebc-8abae30ffb1a",
    "name": "My API Client",
    "type": "read",
    "projectId": "my-project",
    "organizationId": "org_123",
    "ignoreCorsAndSecret": false,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00.000Z",
    "secret": "sec_b2521ca283bf903b46b3"
  }
}
```

**Important**: The `secret` field is only returned once when the client is created. Store it securely immediately. You cannot retrieve the secret later - if lost, you'll need to delete and recreate the client.

### Update Client

Update an existing client's name.

```
PATCH /manage/clients/{id}
```

#### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|

#### Request Body

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | No | New client name (minimum 1 character) |

**Note**: Currently, only the `name` field can be updated. To change the client type or project association, delete and recreate the client.

#### Example Request

    "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T11:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Delete Client

Permanently delete a client. This action cannot be undone.

```
DELETE /manage/clients/{id}
```

#### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | The ID of the client (UUID) |

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.openpanel.dev/manage/clients/b8904453-863d-4e04-8ebc-8abae30ffb1a' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-id: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_ID' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-secret: YOUR_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Warning**: Deleting a client is permanent. Any applications using this client will immediately lose access. Make sure to update your applications before deleting a client.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP response codes. Common error responses:

### 400 Bad Request

```json
{
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid request body",
  "details": [
    {
      "path": ["name"],
      "message": "String must contain at least 1 character(s)"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Manage: Only root clients are allowed to manage resources"
}
```

### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Client not found"
}
```

### 429 Too Many Requests

Rate limiting response includes headers indicating your rate limit status.

## Rate Limiting

The Clients API implements rate limiting:
- **20 requests per 10 seconds** per client
- Rate limit headers included in responses
- Implement exponential backoff for retries

## Security Best Practices

1. **Store Secrets Securely**: Client secrets are only shown once on creation. Store them in secure credential management systems
2. **Use Appropriate Client Types**: Use the minimum required access level for each use case
3. **Rotate Secrets Regularly**: Delete old clients and create new ones to rotate secrets
4. **Never Expose Secrets**: Never commit client secrets to version control or expose them in client-side code
5. **Monitor Client Usage**: Regularly review and remove unused clients

## Notes

- Client IDs are UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers)
- Client secrets are automatically generated with the format `sec_` followed by random hex characters
- Secrets are hashed using argon2 before storage
- Clients can be associated with a project or exist at the organization level
- Clients are scoped to your organization - you can only manage clients in your organization
- The `ignoreCorsAndSecret` field is an advanced setting that bypasses CORS and secret validation (use with caution)
