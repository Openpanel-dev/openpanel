## Authentication

To authenticate with the OpenPanel API, you need to use your `clientId` and `clientSecret`. Different API endpoints may require different access levels:

- **Track API**: Default client works with `write` mode
- **Export API**: Requires `read` or `root` mode
- **Insights API**: Requires `read` or `root` mode
- **Manage API**: Requires `root` mode only

The default client (created with a project) has `write` mode and does not have access to the Export, Insights, or Manage APIs. You'll need to create additional clients with appropriate access levels.

## Headers

Include the following headers with your API requests:

- `openpanel-client-id`: Your OpenPanel client ID
- `openpanel-client-secret`: Your OpenPanel client secret

## Example

```bash
curl 'https://api.openpanel.dev/insights/{projectId}/metrics' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID' \
  -H 'openpanel-client-secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Store credentials securely**: Never expose your `clientId` and `clientSecret` in client-side code
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to ensure secure communication
3. **Rotate credentials**: Regularly rotate your API credentials
4. **Limit access**: Use the minimum required access level for your use case

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid client credentials"
}
```

Common authentication errors:
- Invalid client ID or secret
- Client doesn't have required permissions (e.g., trying to access Manage API with a non-root client)
- Malformed client ID (must be a valid UUIDv4)
- Client type mismatch (e.g., `write` client trying to access Export API)

## Client Types

OpenPanel supports three client types with different access levels:

| Type | Description | Access |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `write` | Write access | Track API only |
| `read` | Read-only access | Export API, Insights API |
| `root` | Full access | All APIs including Manage API |

**Note**: Root clients have organization-wide access and can manage all resources. Use root clients carefully and store their credentials securely.

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Rate limits vary by endpoint:

- **Track API**: Higher limits for event tracking
- **Export/Insights APIs**: 100 requests per 10 seconds
- **Manage API**: 20 requests per 10 seconds

If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff for retries.

Remember to replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with your actual OpenPanel API credentials.
