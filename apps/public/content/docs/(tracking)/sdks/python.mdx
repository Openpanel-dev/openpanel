The OpenPanel Python SDK allows you to track user behavior in your Python applications. This guide provides instructions for installing and using the Python SDK in your project.

## Installation

<Steps>
### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install openpanel
```

### Initialize

Import and initialize the OpenPanel SDK with your credentials:

```python
from openpanel import OpenPanel

op = OpenPanel(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
)
```

### Configuration Options

<CommonSdkConfig />

Additional Python-specific options:

- `filter` - A function that will be called before tracking an event. If it returns false the event will not be tracked
- `disabled` - Set to `True` to disable all event tracking
- `global_properties` - Dictionary of properties that will be sent with every event

#### Filter Function Example

```python
def my_filter(event):
    # Skip events named 'my_event'
    return event.get('name') != 'my_event'

op = OpenPanel(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    filter=my_filter
)
```

</Steps>

## Usage

### Tracking Events

To track an event, use the `track` method:

```python
# Track a simple event
op.track("button_clicked")

# Track with properties
op.track("purchase_completed", {
    "product_id": "123",
    "price": 99.99,
    "currency": "USD"
})

# Track for a specific user
op.track("login_successful", {
    "method": "google"
}, profile_id="user_123")
```

### Identifying Users

To identify a user, use the `identify` method:

```python
op.identify({
    "profile_id": "123",  # Required
    "first_name": "Joe",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "joe@doe.com",
    "properties": {
        "tier": "premium",
        "company": "Acme Inc"
    }
})
```

### Setting Global Properties

To set properties that will be sent with every event:

```python
op.set_global_properties({
    "app_version": "1.0.2",
    "environment": "production",
    "deployment": "us-east-1"
})
```

### Incrementing Properties

To increment a numeric property on a user profile:

```python
op.increment({
    "profile_id": "1",
    "property": "visits",
    "value": 1  # optional, defaults to 1
})
```

### Decrementing Properties

To decrement a numeric property on a user profile:

```python
op.decrement({
    "profile_id": "1",
    "property": "credits",
    "value": 1  # optional, defaults to 1
})
```

### Clearing User Data

To clear the current user's data:

```python
op.clear()
```

## Advanced Usage

### Thread Safety

<Callout>
The OpenPanel SDK is thread-safe. You can safely use a single instance across multiple threads in your application.
</Callout>

### Error Handling

The SDK includes built-in error handling and will not raise exceptions during normal operation. However, you can wrap SDK calls in try-except blocks for additional safety:

```python
try:
    op.track("important_event", {"critical": True})
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to track event: {e}")
```

### Disabling Tracking

You can temporarily disable all tracking:

```python
# Disable during initialization
op = OpenPanel(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    disabled=True
)

# Or disable after initialization
op.disabled = True
```
