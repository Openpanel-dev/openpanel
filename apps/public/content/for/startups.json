    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How much does OpenPanel cost for a typical startup?",
        "answer": "Most early-stage startups fall in the $2.50–$20/month range. At 100K events/month (a common level for seed-stage), you pay $20/month. Self-hosting is completely free — your only cost is the server."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I switch from Mixpanel or Amplitude?",
        "answer": "Yes. OpenPanel uses a similar event-based tracking model. The API is nearly identical — in most cases, migrating is a find-and-replace from gtag() or mixpanel.track() to window.op('track'). We have migration guides for the most common platforms."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens when I outgrow the free self-hosted version?",
        "answer": "Nothing — the self-hosted version has no usage limits. As your traffic grows, you may need to scale your server, but OpenPanel itself doesn't charge anything for self-hosting regardless of volume."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is OpenPanel GDPR compliant?",
        "answer": "Yes. OpenPanel uses cookieless tracking by default, which means you don't need cookie consent banners under GDPR. Cloud data is stored in the EU. Self-hosting gives you complete control over data location."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does OpenPanel compare to PostHog?",
        "answer": "PostHog offers more features (feature flags, experiments, error tracking) but is more complex and expensive at scale. OpenPanel focuses on core analytics — events, funnels, retention, and user profiles — at a fraction of the cost. If you need a Swiss Army knife, choose PostHog. If you need focused product analytics, choose OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need both Google Analytics and OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "No. OpenPanel includes web analytics (pageviews, referrers, UTM campaigns, devices, countries) alongside product analytics. For most startups, OpenPanel replaces both GA4 and a product analytics tool like Mixpanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "What SDKs are available?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel has SDKs for JavaScript, React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, Astro, Express, React Native, Python, Ruby, Rust, Kotlin, and Swift. There's also a script tag for zero-build setups and a REST API for anything else."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track mobile apps?",
        "answer": "Yes. OpenPanel has native SDKs for React Native, Kotlin (Android), and Swift (iOS). The same events, funnels, and user profiles work across web and mobile."
