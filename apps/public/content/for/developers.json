    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How does self-hosting work?",
        "answer": "Clone the repo, configure environment variables, and run docker compose up. The stack includes PostgreSQL (config), ClickHouse (events), and Redis (caching/queues). A 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM VPS handles most workloads. Deployment guides exist for Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Coolify, and Dokploy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the data architecture?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel uses a three-database strategy: PostgreSQL for relational data (users, projects, dashboards), ClickHouse for analytics events (OLAP, high-volume reads/writes), and Redis for caching, job queues, and real-time pub/sub. Events are ingested via the API, queued in Redis, and batch-written to ClickHouse by background workers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I access raw event data?",
        "answer": "Yes. Self-hosted users can query ClickHouse directly with SQL. Cloud users can export data via the REST API. There's no data sampling — you always see the full dataset."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does cookieless tracking work?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel uses a combination of hashed IP address, user agent, and other browser signals to create anonymous session identifiers. No cookies are set, no local storage is used, and no personally identifiable information is stored. This approach is GDPR compliant without requiring consent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a TypeScript SDK?",
        "answer": "Yes. All JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs (web, React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, Astro, Express) are written in TypeScript with full type definitions. The tracking API is type-safe with autocomplete for event names and properties if you extend the types."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track server-side events?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use the Express SDK, the Python/Ruby/Rust SDKs, or call the REST API directly from any server-side language. Server-side tracking is useful for backend events like payments, API usage, or background job completions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does OpenPanel compare to PostHog for developers?",
        "answer": "PostHog offers more tools (feature flags, experiments, error tracking) but requires more infrastructure to self-host (minimum 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM). OpenPanel focuses on analytics — events, funnels, retention — with a lighter footprint and simpler deployment. Choose PostHog if you need an all-in-one platform; choose OpenPanel if you want focused analytics that's easy to run."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the tracking script size?",
        "answer": "2.3 KB gzipped. For comparison, Google Analytics is ~28 KB, Mixpanel is ~32 KB, and PostHog is ~60 KB. The script loads asynchronously and doesn't block page rendering."
