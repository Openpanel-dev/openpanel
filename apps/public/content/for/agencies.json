      {
        "question": "How does pricing work with multiple client projects?",
        "answer": "You pay based on total event volume across all projects, not per project. For example, if you have 20 client sites generating a combined 100K events/month, you pay $20/month total. All projects share the same plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can clients see their own analytics without a login?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel supports team invitations so clients can be added to their specific project. They'll only see their own data. You can also use the API to build custom dashboards or export reports for client presentations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need cookie consent banners for client sites?",
        "answer": "No. OpenPanel uses cookieless tracking by default, which doesn't require consent under GDPR, CCPA, or PECR. This eliminates one of the most common compliance headaches for agency deployments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I set up tracking for a new client?",
        "answer": "Create a new project in your OpenPanel dashboard, copy the script tag, and add it to the client's website. Page views start tracking immediately. Custom events are one line of JavaScript each. Most setups take under 15 minutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I self-host for agency use?",
        "answer": "Yes. Self-hosting is free and has no project or event limits. Run OpenPanel on your own server to keep all client data under your control. Docker Compose deployment takes about 10 minutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does OpenPanel compare to Google Analytics for agencies?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel is simpler to manage across multiple clients (one account, no Google permissions), privacy-compliant without cookies, and includes product analytics features that GA4 lacks. GA4 has more advanced attribution modeling and integrates with Google Ads. For most agency use cases, OpenPanel saves significant time on setup and compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there an API for building custom reports?",
        "answer": "Yes. OpenPanel has a REST API for querying analytics data, managing projects, and exporting events. You can use it to build custom client dashboards, integrate with your reporting tools, or automate monthly reports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I white-label the analytics dashboard?",
        "answer": "White-labeling is not currently available as a built-in feature. However, since OpenPanel is open source, agencies who self-host can customize the dashboard appearance, including branding. Cloud users can use the API to build branded dashboards."
