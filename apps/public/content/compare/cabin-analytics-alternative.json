    "title": "Why consider OpenPanel over Cabin Analytics?",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Cabin Analytics stands out with its unique carbon-conscious approach to web analytics — measuring not just your traffic, but the environmental impact of your website. Combined with privacy-first tracking and an ultra-lightweight script, it's an appealing choice for environmentally conscious teams. But Cabin is a web-only, cloud-only platform with no self-hosting option, no user identification, and no product analytics capabilities.",
      "OpenPanel provides the same lightweight, privacy-first foundation while adding the depth that growing products need. User identification lets you connect anonymous visits to real accounts, funnels help you optimize conversion flows, and retention analysis shows whether your product keeps users coming back. These features transform analytics from simple traffic counting into actionable product insights.",
      "Self-hosting is a major differentiator. Cabin Analytics is cloud-only, which means your data lives on their servers with no alternative. OpenPanel gives you the choice — use the managed cloud with a free tier, or deploy on your own infrastructure via Docker for complete data ownership. And with native SDKs for iOS, Android, and React Native, OpenPanel works for mobile apps too, not just websites.",
      "If you love Cabin's lightweight and privacy-first approach but need analytics that go deeper than pageviews — especially for SaaS products, mobile apps, or any product where understanding user behavior matters — OpenPanel provides that depth without compromising on simplicity."

        "question": "Is OpenPanel as privacy-friendly as Cabin?",
        "answer": "Both are cookie-free by default and GDPR/CCPA compliant. The key difference is that OpenPanel allows optional user identification for product analytics, while Cabin is strictly anonymous. Cabin stores data exclusively in the EU; OpenPanel lets you choose with self-hosting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why switch from Cabin to OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Teams typically switch when they need self-hosting, user identification, mobile SDKs, funnel analysis, or retention tracking. Cabin excels at simple, anonymous web analytics with carbon tracking, but if you need deeper product insights, OpenPanel provides these capabilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does OpenPanel track carbon footprint like Cabin?",
        "answer": "No. Carbon footprint tracking is a unique Cabin feature. If environmental impact tracking is critical for your organization, you may want to keep Cabin or use another tool for this specific capability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which has the smaller tracking script?",
        "answer": "Cabin's script is smaller at approximately 1KB (77x smaller than Google Analytics). OpenPanel's script is 2.3KB gzipped. Both are significantly lighter than traditional analytics tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I self-host Cabin?",
        "answer": "No. Cabin is cloud-only with no self-hosting option. Your data is always stored on their EU servers. OpenPanel offers full self-hosting with Docker if you need data on your own infrastructure."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does pricing compare?",
        "answer": "Cabin uses flat pricing: Free (1 site, 30-day retention) or $19/month Pro (unlimited sites and retention). OpenPanel uses event-based pricing with 10,000 free events/month. For high-traffic sites, Cabin's flat fee may be more cost-effective."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Cabin support mobile apps?",
        "answer": "No. Cabin is web-only with no mobile SDKs. OpenPanel provides native iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs for mobile app analytics."
