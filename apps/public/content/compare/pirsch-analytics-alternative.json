        "question": "Is OpenPanel as privacy-friendly as Pirsch?",
        "answer": "Yes! Both are cookie-free by default and don't require consent banners. The key difference is that OpenPanel allows optional user identification for product analytics, while Pirsch uses anonymous fingerprinting. You control whether to identify users in OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why switch from Pirsch to OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Teams typically switch when they need: 1) Full product analytics (retention, cohorts, user profiles), 2) Free self-hosting without Enterprise pricing, 3) A permanent free tier, or 4) Native mobile SDKs. Pirsch excels at affordable web analytics but has limitations for product analytics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Pirsch have a free tier?",
        "answer": "No. Pirsch offers a 30-day free trial, then requires a minimum $6/month subscription. OpenPanel provides 10,000 free events monthly with no time limit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I self-host Pirsch for free?",
        "answer": "No. Pirsch self-hosting requires an Enterprise license with custom pricing. While the core library is open source (MIT), running the full SaaS requires a license. OpenPanel offers free self-hosting in a single Docker container."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which has the smaller tracking script?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel's script is 2.3KB, while Pirsch's is about 4KB. Both are significantly smaller than Google Analytics (50KB+). Pirsch also emphasizes server-side integration which adds zero client-side weight."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Pirsch track mobile apps?",
        "answer": "Not natively. Pirsch is designed for web analytics with a backend/server-side focus. You could use their API, but there are no mobile-specific SDKs. OpenPanel offers native iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What will I lose switching from Pirsch?",
        "answer": "Pirsch has a built-in URL shortener with tracking, Google Search Console integration in the dashboard, excellent white labeling options, and strong Go/backend integration. However, you'll gain full product analytics, free self-hosting, and mobile SDKs that Pirsch doesn't offer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Pirsch or OpenPanel better for agencies?",
        "answer": "Pirsch has excellent agency features: extensive white labeling, custom domains, team management, and client access links. Their Plus plan at $12/month with unlimited websites is very affordable. However, if your clients need product analytics or you want free self-hosting, OpenPanel provides more value."
