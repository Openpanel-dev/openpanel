        "question": "Is OpenPanel as privacy-friendly as Simple Analytics?",
        "answer": "Yes! Both are cookie-free by default and don't require consent banners. The key difference is that OpenPanel allows optional user identification for product analytics, while Simple Analytics is strictly anonymous. You control whether to identify users in OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why switch from Simple Analytics to OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Teams typically switch when they need: 1) Product analytics (funnels, retention, cohorts), 2) User identification, 3) Self-hosting options, 4) Longer data retention on the free tier, or 5) Native mobile SDKs. Simple Analytics excels at simple web analytics but doesn't offer these capabilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Simple Analytics have a free tier?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with limitations. Simple Analytics offers a free-forever plan with unlimited pageviews (fair use) but only 30-day data retention and basic features. OpenPanel's free tier includes 10,000 events with full data retention and all features."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I self-host Simple Analytics?",
        "answer": "No. Simple Analytics is a cloud-only service with no self-hosting option. They host all data in the Netherlands on EU servers. OpenPanel offers full self-hosting in a single Docker container if you need complete data control."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which has the smaller tracking script?",
        "answer": "Simple Analytics offers two script versions: a 'light' version at 1.9KB and a full version at 3.7KB (gzipped). OpenPanel's script is 2.3KB. All are significantly smaller than Google Analytics (45KB+)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Simple Analytics track mobile apps?",
        "answer": "Not natively. Simple Analytics is designed for web analytics and doesn't provide mobile SDKs. They have an iOS app to view your dashboard, but not to track mobile app users. OpenPanel offers native iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What will I lose switching from Simple Analytics?",
        "answer": "Simple Analytics has an AI chat assistant that lets you query your analytics conversationally - OpenPanel doesn't have this yet. They also have a Google Analytics import tool, a 'Mini Websites' feature showing referring pages, and an iOS app for viewing dashboards. However, you'll gain product analytics, self-hosting, and user identification that Simple Analytics doesn't offer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Simple Analytics or OpenPanel better for blogs/content sites?",
        "answer": "For simple content sites where you just need traffic stats, Simple Analytics' simplicity and AI assistant are excellent. Their Mini Websites feature is unique for seeing exactly which tweets or pages linked to you. If you're running a SaaS, e-commerce, or any product where understanding user behavior matters, OpenPanel's product analytics features provide more value."
