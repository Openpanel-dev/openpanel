        "question": "Are AppsFlyer and OpenPanel competitors?",
        "answer": "They solve different problems. AppsFlyer is a Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP) focused on attributing app installs to marketing campaigns. OpenPanel is a product analytics platform focused on understanding user behavior within your product. Many companies use both."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can OpenPanel replace AppsFlyer?",
        "answer": "It depends on your needs. If you primarily need mobile attribution (knowing which ad campaign drove an install), you need an MMP like AppsFlyer. If you need product analytics (understanding what users do in your app), OpenPanel is the better choice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is AppsFlyer so expensive?",
        "answer": "AppsFlyer charges per attributed conversion ($0.05-0.07 on Growth plan) plus premium add-ons for fraud protection, raw data access, and audience segmentation. Enterprise contracts can cost $50,000-$100,000+ annually. This pricing reflects their position as the market-leading MMP."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does OpenPanel have fraud protection like AppsFlyer?",
        "answer": "No. Fraud protection is specific to mobile attribution—detecting fake installs and click fraud. Since OpenPanel focuses on product analytics rather than attribution, fraud protection isn't applicable."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can OpenPanel do deep linking like AppsFlyer?",
        "answer": "No. Deep linking (routing users from ads/web to specific app content) is an attribution feature. OpenPanel focuses on analytics after users are in your product."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which is better for mobile games?",
        "answer": "For user acquisition attribution and ad monetization tracking, AppsFlyer (or similar MMPs) is essential. For understanding player behavior, progression funnels, and retention, OpenPanel provides the product analytics that AppsFlyer lacks. Mobile game studios typically use both."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I self-host AppsFlyer?",
        "answer": "No. AppsFlyer is a cloud-only SaaS platform with no self-hosting option. OpenPanel can be fully self-hosted using Docker."
