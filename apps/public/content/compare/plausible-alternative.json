        "question": "Is OpenPanel as privacy-friendly as Plausible?",
        "answer": "Yes! Both are cookie-free by default and don't require consent banners. The key difference is that OpenPanel allows optional user identification for product analytics, while Plausible is strictly anonymous. You control whether to identify users in OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why switch from Plausible to OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Teams typically switch when they need product analytics capabilities: user identification, retention analysis, cohort analysis, and detailed funnel tracking. Plausible excels at simple web analytics, but if you're building a product and need to understand user behavior, OpenPanel provides these features while maintaining privacy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Plausible have a free tier?",
        "answer": "No, Plausible Cloud requires a paid subscription starting at $9/month. They offer a 30-day free trial. The self-hosted Community Edition is free but requires you to manage PostgreSQL and ClickHouse infrastructure. OpenPanel offers a free cloud tier with 10,000 events/month."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which has the smaller tracking script?",
        "answer": "Plausible wins here with a sub-1KB script. OpenPanel's 2.3KB script is still very lightweight but includes more functionality for product analytics. Both are significantly smaller than Google Analytics (45KB+) or Mixpanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Plausible track mobile apps?",
        "answer": "Not officially. Plausible is designed for web analytics and doesn't provide native mobile SDKs. You can send events via their API, but there are no mobile-specific metrics. OpenPanel offers native iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What will I lose switching from Plausible?",
        "answer": "Plausible's Google Search Console integration and GA import tool are features OpenPanel doesn't have. If you rely heavily on these, consider your needs. However, you'll gain product analytics capabilities that Plausible doesn't offer."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does self-hosting compare?",
        "answer": "Plausible CE requires Docker Compose with PostgreSQL and ClickHouse (2GB RAM minimum). OpenPanel runs in a single Docker container with simpler setup. Both use ClickHouse for analytics queries."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Plausible or OpenPanel better for blogs/content sites?",
        "answer": "For simple content sites where you just need traffic stats, Plausible's simplicity is excellent. If you're running a SaaS, e-commerce, or any product where understanding user behavior matters, OpenPanel's product analytics features provide more value."
