    "title": "Why consider OpenPanel over Fathom Analytics?",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Fathom Analytics is a well-respected privacy-first analytics tool known for its clean interface and cookie-free tracking. It's a solid choice for websites that need simple traffic metrics without the complexity of Google Analytics. But Fathom is intentionally limited to web analytics — there's no user identification, no funnels, no retention analysis, and no self-hosting option.",
      "OpenPanel shares Fathom's commitment to privacy and simplicity but extends far beyond basic web metrics. You get full product analytics capabilities including funnel analysis, retention tracking, cohort breakdowns, and individual user profiles. This means you can track not just how many visitors you get, but how they convert, where they drop off, and whether they come back.",
      "Pricing is another significant difference. Fathom has no free tier — plans start at $15 per month with no way to try the product beyond a brief trial. OpenPanel offers 10,000 free events per month on its cloud tier, and unlimited events when self-hosted. Self-hosting is available as a simple Docker deployment, giving teams full data ownership that Fathom's cloud-only model can't provide.",
      "If you love Fathom's privacy-first approach but need deeper analytics to understand user behavior and grow your product, OpenPanel gives you that depth while keeping things simple and affordable."

      {
        "question": "Is OpenPanel as privacy-friendly as Fathom?",
        "answer": "Yes! Both are cookie-free by default and don't require consent banners. The key difference is that OpenPanel allows optional user identification for product analytics, while Fathom is strictly anonymous. You control whether to identify users in OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why switch from Fathom to OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Teams typically switch when they need: 1) Product analytics (funnels, retention, cohorts), 2) User identification, 3) Self-hosting options, or 4) A free tier for starting out. Fathom excels at simple web analytics but doesn't offer these capabilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Fathom have a free tier?",
        "answer": "No. Fathom offers a 7-day free trial, then requires a minimum $15/month subscription. They intentionally don't offer a free tier or discounts. OpenPanel provides 10,000 free events monthly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I self-host Fathom?",
        "answer": "No. Fathom Analytics is cloud-only. Their legacy open-source version (Fathom Lite) exists but uses cookies, has limited features, and is no longer actively developed. OpenPanel offers full self-hosting in a single Docker container."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which has the smaller tracking script?",
        "answer": "They're similar. Fathom's script is approximately 2KB, and OpenPanel's is 2.3KB. Both are significantly smaller than Google Analytics (45KB+) or other enterprise tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Fathom track mobile apps?",
        "answer": "Not natively. Fathom is designed for web analytics and doesn't provide mobile SDKs. You could send events via their API, but there are no mobile-specific features. OpenPanel offers native iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What will I lose switching from Fathom?",
        "answer": "Fathom's Google Analytics import tool is well-regarded if you're migrating historical data. Their EU Isolation feature is enabled by default for all customers. However, you'll gain product analytics, self-hosting options, and a free tier that Fathom doesn't offer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Fathom or OpenPanel better for blogs/content sites?",
        "answer": "For simple content sites where you just need traffic stats, Fathom's simplicity is excellent and their GA importer helps with transitions. If you're running a SaaS, e-commerce, or any product where understanding user behavior matters, OpenPanel's product analytics features provide more value."
      }
