    "title": "Why consider OpenPanel over Matomo?",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Matomo is one of the most established open-source analytics platforms, used by over 1.4 million websites worldwide. It offers both self-hosted and cloud options with a strong focus on privacy and data ownership. However, Matomo's age shows in its interface, and many essential features like funnels, A/B testing, and heatmaps are locked behind premium plugins that cost $229 per year each.",
      "OpenPanel is a modern, open-source alternative that includes all features at every tier \u2014 no premium plugins, no upsells. Funnels, cohorts, retention analysis, A/B testing, and user profiles are all available whether you're on the free tier or self-hosting. The interface is clean and modern, designed for today's product teams rather than as a legacy dashboard.",
      "A critical difference is cookie-free tracking. While Matomo can be configured for cookieless mode, it uses cookies by default and still requires a consent banner in most GDPR scenarios. OpenPanel is truly cookie-free from the start, with no configuration needed. Self-hosting is also dramatically simpler \u2014 a single Docker container versus Matomo's PHP, MySQL, and web server stack.",
      "For teams who value Matomo's open-source philosophy but want a modern experience with all features included, lighter tracking (2.3 KB vs 20 KB), and simpler deployment \u2014 OpenPanel delivers what Matomo promises, without the hidden costs."

        "answer": "Matomo On-Premise (self-hosted) is free and open-source. However, many important features like Heatmaps, Session Recordings, A/B Testing, Funnels, and Form Analytics require purchasing premium plugins ($33-549/year each). Matomo Cloud starts at $19/month for 50,000 hits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why switch from Matomo?",
        "answer": "Common reasons include: premium plugins add up quickly for essential features, the PHP/MySQL stack requires maintenance, the UI feels dated compared to modern tools, and configuring true cookieless tracking is complex. OpenPanel offers a simpler experience with all features included."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a cookie consent banner with Matomo?",
        "answer": "By default, yes. Matomo uses first-party cookies and requires consent under GDPR. It can be configured for CNIL exemption (consent-free) in France and some EU countries, but this requires specific settings and limits some features. OpenPanel is cookie-free by default."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Matomo work without cookies?",
        "answer": "Yes, but it requires configuration. You need to enable cookieless tracking, anonymize IPs, and disable features like User ID tracking. Even then, you may still need consent in some jurisdictions. OpenPanel's cookieless approach works by default without compromises."
      },
      {
        "question": "What Matomo features will I lose?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel doesn't have heatmaps, session recordings, form analytics, or a tag manager. If you rely heavily on these visual UX tools, Matomo may still be the better fit. However, you'll gain simpler setup and all core analytics features included."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Matomo GDPR compliant?",
        "answer": "Yes, Matomo is GDPR compliant and is used by the European Commission. Matomo Cloud data is stored in Frankfurt, Germany. However, GDPR compliance doesn't automatically mean you can skip consent - that depends on your specific configuration and jurisdiction."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does self-hosting compare?",
        "answer": "Matomo requires PHP 7.2.5+ and MySQL/MariaDB, with additional configuration for performance at scale. OpenPanel uses Docker with ClickHouse for analytics queries, offering simpler deployment and better query performance for most use cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is OpenPanel as mature as Matomo?",
