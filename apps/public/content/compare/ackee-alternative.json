        "answer": "Yes! Both are cookie-free by default and can be GDPR compliant without consent banners. The key difference is that OpenPanel allows optional user identification for product analytics, while Ackee is strictly anonymous. You control whether to identify users in OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why switch from Ackee to OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Teams typically switch when they need: product analytics (funnels, retention, cohorts), user identification, a managed cloud option, mobile SDKs, or a database optimized for analytics. Ackee excels at simple, anonymous web stats but lacks these capabilities."

      {
        "question": "Is Ackee really free?",
        "answer": "Yes, Ackee itself is 100% free and open source. However, you must pay for your own hosting - a server to run Ackee and MongoDB. Using free tiers (Vercel + MongoDB Atlas 512MB), you can run Ackee at zero cost for small sites."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does OpenPanel have a GraphQL API like Ackee?",
        "answer": "No, OpenPanel uses a REST API while Ackee uses GraphQL. Both approaches allow building custom tools and integrations. Ackee's entire UI is powered by its GraphQL API, making it very extensible."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Ackee track mobile apps?",
        "answer": "Not officially. Ackee is designed for web analytics. There's a community Dart/Flutter package, but no official iOS or Android SDKs. OpenPanel offers native mobile SDKs with full product analytics."

      {
        "question": "What will I lose switching from Ackee?",
        "answer": "Ackee's GraphQL API (OpenPanel uses REST), the ability to host on platforms like Vercel/Netlify as serverless functions, and the community plugins like Svelte and Angular integrations. You'll gain product analytics, user identification, and a managed cloud option."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the database compare?",
        "answer": "Ackee uses MongoDB (general-purpose document database) while OpenPanel uses ClickHouse (columnar database optimized for analytics). ClickHouse is significantly faster for analytical queries, especially at scale."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Ackee track unique visitors?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with limitations. Ackee uses a daily-rotating salt hash (IP + user-agent + domain + salt) to identify visitors within a single day. It cannot track returning visitors across days or track unique views per page - this is by design for privacy."
