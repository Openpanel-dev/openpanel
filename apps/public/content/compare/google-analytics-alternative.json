    "title": "Why teams are switching from Google Analytics to OpenPanel",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Google Analytics has been the default analytics tool since 2005. But the forced migration to GA4 fundamentally changed the product \u2014 the new event-based model has a steep learning curve, the interface is confusing for most users, and data retention dropped to just 14 months on the free tier. Meanwhile, privacy regulations like GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive mean GA4 requires cookie consent banners that hurt conversion rates and annoy visitors.",
      "OpenPanel is built for the post-GA4 world. It's fully open source under the AGPL-3.0 license, which means you can inspect, modify, and self-host the entire codebase. Unlike Google Analytics, OpenPanel tracks visitors without cookies \u2014 no consent banners needed, and full GDPR compliance out of the box. Your data stays on EU servers in Sweden, or you can self-host on your own infrastructure for complete data sovereignty.",
      "Where GA4 splits functionality between free and enterprise tiers ($50,000+/year for GA4 360), OpenPanel gives you everything in one package: real-time dashboards, funnels, retention analysis, cohorts, user profiles, custom events, and revenue tracking. The SDK is just 2.3 KB gzipped \u2014 over 13x smaller than Google's gtag.js \u2014 which directly improves your Core Web Vitals and page load times.",
      "OpenPanel also goes beyond what GA4 offers for free: built-in A/B testing, unlimited data retention (when self-hosted), no data sampling, and direct SQL access to your analytics data via ClickHouse. If you don't rely heavily on Google Ads attribution, OpenPanel gives you better analytics with better privacy at a fraction of the complexity."

    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Is Google Analytics open source?",
        "answer": "No. Google Analytics is a proprietary, closed-source product owned by Google. You cannot inspect the tracking code, verify how your data is processed, or self-host it. OpenPanel is fully open source under the AGPL-3.0 license \u2014 the complete source code is available on GitHub for anyone to audit, modify, or self-host."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Google Analytics really free?",
        "answer": "GA4 is free to use, but the cost is your visitors' privacy \u2014 data is processed on Google's US servers and used within Google's advertising ecosystem. There are also significant feature limitations: 14-month data retention, data sampling at high volumes, and no BigQuery export. GA4 360 removes these limits but costs $50,000+/year. OpenPanel offers a free self-hosted option with no limitations, or cloud hosting starting at $2.50/month."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are people switching away from Google Analytics?",
        "answer": "The main reasons teams switch from GA4 are: 1) Privacy concerns \u2014 data sent to Google's US servers creates GDPR compliance issues, 2) Cookie consent banners \u2014 GA4 requires them, which hurts UX and conversion rates, 3) GA4 complexity \u2014 the new interface and event model have a steep learning curve, 4) Data limitations \u2014 sampling, short retention, and limited exports on the free tier, 5) Performance \u2014 the 30+ KB gtag.js script impacts page load speed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a cookie consent banner with OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "No. OpenPanel uses cookie-free tracking by default. It doesn't store cookies or collect personal data, so no consent banner is required under GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, or PECR. This improves user experience and can boost conversion rates by 2-5% compared to sites with consent banners."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is OpenPanel GDPR compliant?",
        "answer": "Yes. OpenPanel is based in Sweden (EU), uses cookie-free tracking, hashes IP addresses with daily rotating salts, stores data exclusively on EU servers, and offers self-hosting for complete data sovereignty. We also provide DPA agreements on request."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I self-host OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Yes. OpenPanel can be self-hosted using a single Docker container with our setup script. The entire process takes about 15 minutes. When self-hosted, you get unlimited events, unlimited data retention, and complete control over your data \u2014 no usage fees. The source code is available under the AGPL-3.0 license."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I import my Google Analytics data into OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Google Analytics doesn't provide an easy data export mechanism, so direct migration of historical data isn't possible. Most teams run OpenPanel alongside GA4 for 1-2 weeks to verify data, then switch completely. Your historical GA4 data remains accessible in Google Analytics for your configured retention period."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does OpenPanel compare to other GA alternatives like Plausible or Matomo?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel is unique because it combines web analytics (like Plausible) with product analytics (like Mixpanel) in one open-source tool. Plausible is simpler but lacks funnels, cohorts, and user profiles. Matomo is feature-rich but requires cookies and has a heavier setup. OpenPanel gives you the best of both worlds with a tiny 2.3 KB SDK."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does OpenPanel integrate with Google Ads?",
        "answer": "No. If you rely heavily on Google Ads conversion tracking and multi-touch attribution, GA4 remains the better choice for that specific use case. OpenPanel focuses on privacy-first analytics for teams that don't need deep Google Ads integration."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the SDK size affect my website's performance?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel's JavaScript SDK is 2.3 KB gzipped, compared to Google Analytics' 30+ KB. That's a 13x difference that directly impacts your Core Web Vitals scores, page load times, and potentially your SEO rankings. For mobile users on slower connections, the difference is even more noticeable."
