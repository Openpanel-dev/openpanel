    "title": "Why consider OpenPanel over Google Analytics?",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Google Analytics has been the default analytics tool for over a decade, powering millions of websites with detailed traffic and conversion data. However, the shift to GA4 has left many teams frustrated with its steep learning curve, complex event model, and reduced data retention. Add to that growing privacy concerns around sending visitor data to Google's US servers, and it's no surprise that more teams are looking for a Google Analytics alternative.",
      "OpenPanel is a privacy-first, open-source analytics platform that combines web analytics and product analytics in a single tool. Unlike Google Analytics, OpenPanel tracks visitors without cookies, which means no consent banners and full GDPR compliance out of the box. Your data stays on EU servers, or you can self-host on your own infrastructure for complete control.",
      "Where Google Analytics excels in its deep integration with the Google Ads ecosystem, OpenPanel focuses on giving you clean, actionable insights without the complexity. You get real-time dashboards, funnels, retention analysis, cohorts, and user profiles — features that typically require GA4 360 or a separate product analytics tool. And at just 2.3 KB, the OpenPanel SDK is over 10x lighter than Google's gtag script, which means faster page loads and better Core Web Vitals.",
      "If your team doesn't rely heavily on Google Ads attribution, OpenPanel gives you everything you need at a fraction of the cost and complexity — with the added benefit of owning your data completely."

        "answer": "Yes, GA4 is free but comes with significant tradeoffs: your data goes to Google, cookies require consent banners, data retention is limited to 14 months, and high-traffic sites experience data sampling. GA4 360 (enterprise) costs $50,000+/year."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why switch from Google Analytics?",
        "answer": "Common reasons include: privacy concerns (data sent to Google), GDPR compliance (cookies require consent), complexity (GA4 has a steep learning curve), and data ownership (you can't self-host or fully export your data)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a cookie consent banner with OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "No. OpenPanel is cookie-free by default and doesn't collect personal data, so no consent banner is required for analytics. This improves user experience and conversion rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is OpenPanel GDPR compliant?",
        "answer": "Yes. OpenPanel is EU-based (Sweden), uses cookie-free tracking, hashes IP addresses with daily rotating salts, and stores data on EU servers. We also offer DPA agreements on request."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I import my Google Analytics data?",
        "answer": "Google Analytics doesn't provide easy data export for migration. We recommend running OpenPanel in parallel with GA4 briefly, then starting fresh with OpenPanel for cleaner, privacy-compliant data."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does OpenPanel track users without cookies?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel uses a privacy-friendly approach: IP addresses and user agents are hashed together with a daily rotating salt. This allows accurate visitor counting (within a 24-hour window) without storing any personal data."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does OpenPanel integrate with Google Ads?",
        "answer": "No, OpenPanel doesn't have native Google Ads integration. If you rely heavily on Google Ads conversion tracking and attribution, GA4 remains the better choice for that specific use case."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the SDK size affect my website?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel's JavaScript SDK is ~2.3 KB gzipped compared to GA4's 30+ KB. This means faster page loads, better Core Web Vitals scores, and potentially improved SEO rankings."
