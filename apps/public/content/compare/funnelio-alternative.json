    "title": "Why consider OpenPanel over Funnel.io?",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Funnel.io is a marketing data integration platform designed to aggregate data from over 500 advertising platforms and marketing tools into unified reports. It's used by marketing teams at large organizations to bring together campaign performance data from Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn, and hundreds of other sources. But Funnel.io doesn't track user behavior at all — it aggregates data that already exists in external platforms.",
      "OpenPanel and Funnel.io serve fundamentally different purposes. Funnel.io answers the question 'how are my marketing campaigns performing across platforms?' while OpenPanel answers 'what are users doing inside my product?' If you need to track events, build funnels, analyze retention, and understand user behavior, that's product analytics — and that's what OpenPanel does.",
      "The cost difference reflects these different markets. Funnel.io starts at $399 per month with no free tier, targeting enterprise marketing teams with large budgets. OpenPanel starts at $2.50 per month with a free tier of 10,000 events, or can be self-hosted for free. For product teams and startups, OpenPanel delivers actionable analytics without the enterprise price tag.",
      "If you're evaluating analytics tools and Funnel.io appeared in your search, you likely need product analytics rather than marketing data aggregation. OpenPanel gives you the user behavior insights, funnel analysis, and retention tracking that help you build better products — with open-source transparency and the option to self-host."

      },
      {
        "question": "Does Funnel.io track user events on my website?",
        "answer": "No. Funnel.io imports data from external platforms like Google Analytics, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads via API connectors. It does not provide tracking SDKs or directly track user behavior. For event tracking, you need a product analytics tool like OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is Funnel.io so expensive compared to OpenPanel?",
        "answer": "Funnel.io's pricing (starting at $399/month) reflects its value proposition: maintaining 500+ API connectors to marketing platforms, handling data transformation, and providing BI tool integrations. OpenPanel tracks your own product data with lightweight SDKs, which has different cost structures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I self-host Funnel.io?",
        "answer": "No. Funnel.io is cloud-only SaaS with no self-hosting option. OpenPanel is open source (MIT license) and can be self-hosted via Docker for full data control."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Funnel.io have mobile SDKs?",
        "answer": "No. Funnel.io does not provide tracking SDKs for any platform. It imports data from external sources via API connectors. OpenPanel provides native iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs for mobile app analytics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which tool should I use for conversion funnels?",
        "answer": "It depends on what you're measuring. OpenPanel tracks user conversion funnels in your product (signup to purchase, onboarding completion). Funnel.io reports on marketing funnel metrics imported from ad platforms. They measure different things."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can OpenPanel replace Funnel.io for marketing reporting?",
        "answer": "Not directly. OpenPanel doesn't have connectors to import data from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, or other marketing platforms. If you need cross-platform marketing spend reporting, you'll still need a tool like Funnel.io or Supermetrics."
