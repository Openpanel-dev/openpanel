    "title": "Why consider OpenPanel over Countly?",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Countly positions itself as an all-in-one product analytics platform with built-in push notifications, crash reporting, remote configuration, and surveys. It's a feature-rich platform that appeals to teams wanting everything under one roof. But that breadth comes with significant costs — MAU-based pricing that can reach $132,000 or more per year, a complex self-hosted setup requiring MongoDB, Node.js, and Nginx, and a restrictive AGPL license for the free tier that limits commercial use.",
      "OpenPanel takes a focused approach to analytics with simpler pricing and deployment. Instead of bundling push notifications and crash reporting (which most teams already have through dedicated tools), OpenPanel focuses on what matters most: understanding user behavior through events, funnels, retention analysis, and cohort breakdowns. All features are included at every tier, with no premium add-ons or feature gating.",
      "The licensing and pricing differences are substantial. Countly's free Lite tier uses AGPL licensing that prohibits commercial use, and paid plans start at $80 per month for just 2,000 MAUs. OpenPanel uses the permissive MIT license for unlimited commercial use, and its event-based pricing starts at $2.50 per month — or is completely free when self-hosted with no restrictions.",
      "For teams that want straightforward product analytics without the complexity and cost of an all-in-one platform, OpenPanel delivers the analytics essentials with a dramatically simpler setup, lower cost, and more permissive licensing."

    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Is Countly really open source?",
        "answer": "Partially. Countly Lite is open source under AGPL-3.0 with modified terms, but it explicitly prohibits commercial use. For business use, you must purchase Countly Enterprise or use Countly Flex (their SaaS). OpenPanel is fully open source under MIT license with no commercial restrictions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is OpenPanel cheaper than Countly?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel uses event-based pricing with 10,000 free events/month. Countly charges by Monthly Active Users (MAUs) starting at $80/month for just 2,000 MAUs, plus additional fees for features like A/B testing, surveys, and push notifications as add-ons."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does OpenPanel have push notifications like Countly?",
        "answer": "No. Countly is an all-in-one platform including push notifications, surveys, and remote configuration. OpenPanel focuses purely on product analytics. You would need separate tools like OneSignal or Firebase for push notifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does OpenPanel have crash reporting?",
        "answer": "No. Countly includes comprehensive crash and error reporting with symbolication. OpenPanel focuses on product analytics. For crash reporting, consider tools like Sentry or Crashlytics alongside OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does self-hosting compare?",
        "answer": "OpenPanel runs in a simple Docker container with ClickHouse. Countly requires MongoDB, Node.js, and Nginx with a more complex installation script. Countly's upgrade process can be tedious for older versions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which has better mobile SDK support?",
        "answer": "Countly has broader SDK coverage including Flutter, Unity, and desktop (Windows/Mac). OpenPanel supports iOS, Android, and React Native. Choose based on your specific platform needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Countly better for enterprise?",
        "answer": "Countly Enterprise offers ISO 27001 and SOC2 certifications, SLAs, and direct support - important for large enterprises with strict compliance needs. OpenPanel is better suited for startups and teams prioritizing simplicity and cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Countly Lite for my startup?",
        "answer": "No. Countly Lite's license explicitly states: 'you cannot use Countly Lite for commercial or non-commercial purposes, to provide Countly as a service to your customers.' For business use, you must purchase Countly Enterprise or Flex."
