Self-hosted web analytics gives you something cloud-only tools can't: **complete ownership of your data**. No third-party servers. No vendor lock-in. No surprise pricing changes. Your analytics data lives on your infrastructure, under your control.

But which self-hosted analytics tool should you actually use? There are over a dozen options, and they vary wildly in features, deployment complexity, and what they're good at.

We tested and compared the most popular self-hosted web analytics tools so you don't have to. Here's what we found.

## Quick Comparison

## How to Choose the Right Self-Hosted Analytics Tool

Before picking a tool, think about what you actually need:

**Web analytics vs product analytics.** If you only need pageviews, traffic sources, and referrals, a simple web analytics tool like Plausible or Umami will do. If you also need [funnels](/features/funnels), [retention analysis](/features/retention), user identification, and [event tracking](/features/event-tracking), you need a tool with product analytics capabilities.

**Deployment complexity.** Some tools deploy in under 5 minutes with a single Docker Compose command. Others need Kubernetes clusters, multiple databases, or PHP environments. Be honest about your ops capacity.

**Maintenance burden.** Self-hosting means you handle updates, backups, and scaling. Simpler tools like GoatCounter or Umami need minimal maintenance. Feature-rich tools like Matomo or PostHog require more attention.

**Privacy and compliance.** All self-hosted tools keep data on your servers. But some go further with cookieless tracking (no consent banners needed), while others still use cookies by default.

**Cost at scale.** Self-hosting isn't free — you pay for server infrastructure. A $5/month VPS handles most small-to-medium sites, but high-traffic sites need more resources.

## Self-Hosted vs Cloud Analytics: When to Self-Host

Self-hosting isn't always the right choice. Here's when it makes sense — and when it doesn't.

### Self-host when:

- **You need data sovereignty.** Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific rules require data to stay on your infrastructure. Self-hosting eliminates third-party data transfers entirely. Read more in our [compliance guide](/articles/better-compliance-self-hosted-analytics).
- **You want predictable costs.** Cloud analytics pricing scales with events or pageviews. Self-hosting costs are your server costs, which are more predictable and often cheaper at scale.
- **You have ops capacity.** Someone on your team can manage Docker, handle updates, and monitor uptime.
- **You want full control.** Custom retention policies, direct database access, integration with internal systems.

### Use cloud when:

- **You want zero maintenance.** No server management, no updates, no uptime monitoring.
- **You're just getting started.** Cloud gets you analytics in minutes. Self-hosting takes longer to set up.
- **Your team is small.** If nobody on the team is comfortable managing infrastructure, cloud is safer.
- **You need guaranteed uptime.** Cloud providers handle redundancy and failover.

Most self-hosted analytics tools also offer cloud versions. With [OpenPanel](/pricing), you can start with Cloud and migrate to self-hosting later — or vice versa — since the features are identical.

## How to Get Started with Self-Hosted Analytics

### 1. Pick a server

You need a VPS. For most self-hosted analytics tools, a server with 2-4 vCPU, 4-8 GB RAM, and 40 GB SSD is enough to start.

Recommended providers:
- **[Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=7Hq0H5mQh7tM)** — Best price-to-performance. A CX31 (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) costs around €8.50/month.
- **DigitalOcean** — Easy to use, good documentation. Droplets from $6/month.
- **Vultr** — Similar to DigitalOcean with competitive pricing.
- **AWS/GCP** — More complex, but useful if you're already in their ecosystem.

### 2. Secure your server

Before installing anything, lock down your server. At minimum: disable root login, set up SSH keys, configure a firewall. We have a full guide on [how to secure your Ubuntu server](/articles/how-to-secure-ubuntu-server).

### 3. Install your analytics tool

Each tool has its own installation process. For OpenPanel, it's four commands:

```bash
git clone -b self-hosting https://github.com/Openpanel-dev/openpanel && cd openpanel/self-hosting && ./setup
./start
```

The setup wizard handles everything — Docker, databases, SSL certificates. Full walkthrough: [How to self-host OpenPanel](/articles/how-to-self-host-openpanel).

### 4. Add tracking to your site

Install the tracking script on your website. With OpenPanel, you add a small JavaScript snippet or use one of the framework-specific SDKs (React, Next.js, Vue, and more). Check the [SDK documentation](/docs/get-started/install-openpanel) for your stack.

<Faqs>
<FaqItem question="What is the best self-hosted web analytics tool?">
It depends on your needs. For combined web and product analytics, OpenPanel offers the best value. For simple pageview tracking, Plausible is the most popular. For a full Google Analytics replacement, Matomo has the most features. For the lightest option, GoatCounter or Umami work well.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Is self-hosted analytics free?">
The software is free for most tools (OpenPanel, Plausible, Matomo, Umami, GoatCounter, PostHog, and Ackee all offer free self-hosting). Your cost is the server infrastructure — typically $5-50/month for a VPS depending on your traffic volume.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Do I need a cookie banner with self-hosted analytics?">
Not if your tool uses cookieless tracking. OpenPanel, Plausible, Umami, GoatCounter, and Ackee all track without cookies, so no cookie consent banner is needed for basic analytics. Matomo uses cookies by default but offers a cookieless mode.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Can I self-host analytics and be GDPR compliant?">
Yes. Self-hosting is one of the strongest approaches for GDPR compliance because your data never leaves your infrastructure. There are no third-party data transfers to worry about, and you have full control over data retention and deletion. Tools like OpenPanel and Plausible add cookieless tracking on top, making compliance even simpler.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="How much server resources do I need for self-hosted analytics?">
For most tools: 2-4 vCPU, 4-8 GB RAM, and 40 GB SSD handles up to a few hundred thousand events per month. PostHog needs more (16 GB RAM minimum). GoatCounter and Ackee run on minimal resources. Scale up as your traffic grows.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="What is the difference between self-hosted web analytics and product analytics?">
Web analytics tracks website traffic — pageviews, referrals, devices, and geographic data. Product analytics tracks user behavior within your product — events, funnels, retention, and user journeys. Some tools like OpenPanel and PostHog offer both. Most self-hosted tools (Plausible, Umami, GoatCounter) focus on web analytics only. See our guide on [self-hosted product analytics](/articles/self-hosted-product-analytics) for tools that cover the product side.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Can I migrate from Google Analytics to a self-hosted tool?">
Yes. Matomo offers direct Google Analytics data import. Other tools like OpenPanel and Plausible let you start fresh with their tracking. You can run both in parallel during the transition to make sure you're comfortable with the new tool before removing GA.
</FaqItem>
