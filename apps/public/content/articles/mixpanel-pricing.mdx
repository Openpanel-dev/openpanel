Mixpanel is one of the most popular product analytics tools out there. It's powerful, well-designed, and used by thousands of companies. But before you commit, you probably want to understand exactly what you'll be paying.

Mixpanel's pricing has gone through several changes over the years. They've made it more transparent recently, which is great. But there are still some things that aren't immediately obvious when you're looking at their pricing page.

In this guide, we'll break down exactly how Mixpanel pricing works, what you get at each tier, and some things to watch out for as your usage grows.

## How Mixpanel Pricing Works

Mixpanel uses event-based pricing. This means you pay based on the number of events you track, not the number of users on your team or the number of projects you have.

An "event" is any user action you decide to track. A button click, a page view, a purchase, a sign-up. Each one counts as an event. If you track 10 different actions and have 10,000 monthly active users, you could easily be looking at millions of events per month.

Mixpanel offers three main plans: Free, Growth, and Enterprise.

## Mixpanel Free Plan

The free plan is genuinely generous for getting started. You get up to 20 million events per month, which sounds like a lot. For many small projects and early-stage startups, this is plenty.

Here's what's included in the free plan:

The core analytics features work well. You get access to Insights, [Funnels](/features/funnels), Flows, and [Retention](/features/retention) reports. You can create unlimited reports and dashboards. The data is real-time, and you can segment by any property you're tracking.

However, there are limitations. You don't get access to some of the more advanced features like behavioral cohorts, saved metrics, or custom properties beyond the basics. The free plan also doesn't include Group Analytics, which is pretty much essential if you're building a B2B product and want to analyze data at the company level rather than just individual users.

There's also no data export on the free plan. If you want to pull your data into a warehouse or analyze it elsewhere, you'll need to upgrade.

## Mixpanel Growth Plan

The Growth plan is where most paying customers land. As of early 2025, Mixpanel made the Growth plan more accessible by including the first 1 million events free each month when you add a credit card.

After that first million, you pay based on your event volume. The pricing scales something like this:

- 1.5 million events: around $140/month
- 5 million events: around $612.5/month  
- 10 million events: around $1,176/month
- 20 million events: around $2,289/month

These are approximate figures since Mixpanel's pricing page uses a slider and the exact numbers depend on your specific configuration.

The Growth plan adds several important features over Free. You get full access to advanced analysis tools including multi-touch attribution, formulas, saved metrics, and behavioral cohorts. Custom properties become more flexible. You also get access to experiment analysis and more detailed reporting.

One thing to note: these prices are for the core analytics. Add-ons cost extra.

## Free vs Growth Plan: What's the Difference?

If you're trying to decide whether to stay on Free or upgrade to Growth, here's a detailed breakdown of what you get with each plan:

| Feature | Free Plan | Growth Plan |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Monthly events** | Up to 1M | First 1M free, up to 20M |
| **Saved reports** | 5 per seat | Unlimited |
| **Session replays** | 10K/month | 20K free (up to 500K) |
| **Spark AI queries** | 30/month | 60/month |
| **Behavioral cohorts** | Limited | Full access |
| **Custom properties** | Limited | Full access |
| **Formulas & saved metrics** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Impact & statistical significance** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Multi-touch attribution** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Monitoring alerts** | 5 per project | Unlimited |
| **Anomaly detection** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Root cause analysis** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Experiment reporting** | ❌ | Add-on |
| **Feature flags** | ❌ | Add-on |
| **Account-level analytics** | ❌ | Add-on |
| **Data pipelines** | ❌ | Add-on |
| **Lookup tables** | Limited | Full access |
| **Support** | Email (standard) | Email (24/5) |

The key takeaway: Free is genuinely useful for basic analytics, but once you need advanced features like formulas, cohort analysis, or more than 5 saved reports per person, you'll need to upgrade. And even on Growth, several important features like account-level analytics and data pipelines are still add-ons.

## Mixpanel Enterprise Plan

Enterprise pricing isn't published. You need to contact sales, and pricing depends on your specific needs, event volume, and how good you are at negotiating.

Based on publicly available information from sites that track B2B pricing, Enterprise plans typically start around $20,000 per year for MTU-based pricing (monthly tracked users) or around $27,000 per year for 300 million events on event-based pricing.

Enterprise adds features like SSO, advanced permissions and data governance, dedicated support, custom contracts, and access to some exclusive reports like Signal and Impact.

If you're a larger organization with compliance requirements or need specific security features, Enterprise is likely where you'll end up.

## The Add-Ons That Add Up

Here's where Mixpanel pricing gets a bit tricky. Several features that you might consider core functionality are actually paid add-ons, even on Growth plans.

**Group Analytics** is the big one. If you're building a B2B product, you almost certainly need this. It lets you analyze data at the account or company level, not just individual users. Without it, you can't answer basic questions like "which companies are most engaged?" or "what's our retention by account?" Group Analytics is a separate line item on your bill.

**Data Pipelines** is another common add-on. This lets you export your Mixpanel data to a data warehouse like BigQuery, Snowflake, or Redshift. Based on publicly available pricing data, this can add around $19,000+ annually for larger implementations. If you need your analytics data in your warehouse for broader analysis or reporting, this cost adds up.

**Session Replay** lets you watch recordings of user sessions. It's useful for understanding the context behind your quantitative data, but it's another add-on with its own pricing.

**Warehouse Connectors** allow you to import data from your warehouse into Mixpanel. Again, separate pricing.

When budgeting for Mixpanel, make sure you factor in which add-ons you'll actually need. The base plan price can be misleading if you end up needing two or three add-ons to do what you want.

## Mixpanel Startup Program

If you're an early-stage startup, Mixpanel offers a pretty solid deal. Their startup program gives you access to a "Startup Plan" free for one year.

To qualify, your company needs to be founded less than 5 years ago, have less than $8 million in total funding, and not have previously redeemed similar offers.

The Startup Plan includes advanced features, Group Analytics, Data Pipelines, Warehouse Connectors, and Session Replay. You get up to 1 billion events over the year and 500,000 session replay recordings.

There's a catch though: you need to start sending data within 90 days of acceptance, or you get removed from the program. And after the year is up, you'll need to move to a paid plan or downgrade to Free.

It's a good deal if you qualify, but plan ahead for what happens when that first year ends.

## When Mixpanel Gets Expensive

Mixpanel's event-based pricing means your costs are directly tied to your growth. The more successful your product becomes, the more you pay. This makes sense from Mixpanel's perspective, but it can create some challenges for growing companies.

Here's a scenario. Let's say you're tracking 15 different events per user. Your product has 50,000 monthly active users, each doing an average of 20 tracked actions per session, with 3 sessions per month. That's 15 × 50,000 × 20 × 3 = 45 million events per month. You've already blown past the free tier and are looking at significant monthly costs.

Now imagine you launch a marketing campaign that doubles your user base. Your analytics bill just doubled too.

Some teams respond to this by tracking fewer events or being very selective about what they measure. That's not ideal. You want your analytics to grow with your product, not become a constraint on what you can learn about your users.

The other thing that catches people off guard is the gap between the free tier and paid pricing. 20 million events is free. But once you hit 20,000,001 events, you're on a paid plan. The jump can feel steep if you weren't expecting it.

## What Users Say About Mixpanel Pricing

Looking at reviews on G2, Capterra, and similar sites, pricing is one of the most common complaints about Mixpanel. Here are some themes that come up repeatedly:

> "The jump from free to paid can be steep." Many users start on the generous free tier, get comfortable with the tool, and then face a significant cost when they outgrow it.

> "Gets expensive at scale." Companies with large user bases or those tracking many events find costs escalating quickly.

> "Add-ons feel like they should be included." Group Analytics in particular gets called out. For B2B products, it's essentially a required feature, but it's priced separately.

> "Pricing forced us to track less." Some users report deliberately limiting their tracking to stay within budget, which defeats the purpose of having comprehensive analytics.

To be fair, there are also plenty of users who think Mixpanel provides good value, especially compared to building custom analytics infrastructure. The complaints tend to come from teams that have scaled beyond the free tier and are comparing costs to alternatives.

## Mixpanel vs OpenPanel: A Direct Comparison

Since you're reading this on the OpenPanel blog, let's be upfront about how we compare. We built [OpenPanel](/articles/introduction-to-openpanel) specifically as a more affordable alternative to Mixpanel, so we think the comparison is worth making.

Here's how the pricing stacks up at different event volumes:

| Monthly Events | Mixpanel Growth | OpenPanel Cloud |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 100K | ~$28* | $20 |
| 500K | ~$70* | $50 |
| 1M | Free (with card) | $90 |
| 1.5M | ~$140 | $180 |
| 5M | ~$612 | $250 |
| 10M | ~$1,176 | $350 |
| 20M | ~$2,289 | $530 |
| 50M | Contact sales | $900 |

*Mixpanel's free tier covers up to 20M events, but with limited features

At 20 million events, OpenPanel is about 77% cheaper than Mixpanel's Growth plan. But the pricing difference is only part of the story.

**What's included matters.** With [OpenPanel pricing](/pricing), everything is included. Unlimited websites, unlimited users, unlimited dashboards. There are no tiers within tiers, no add-ons, no "contact sales for this feature." You pick your event volume and that's your price.

**Self-hosting is an option.** If you want to go even further on cost savings, you can [self-host OpenPanel](/articles/how-to-self-host-openpanel) for free. Your only cost is the infrastructure itself, which can be surprisingly affordable. A decent VPS can handle millions of events and costs maybe $20-50/month.

**Privacy by default.** OpenPanel uses [cookieless tracking](/articles/cookieless-analytics) out of the box. No cookie consent banners needed. This isn't just about compliance, it means you get more accurate data because you're not losing users who decline cookies.

Obviously, we're biased here. Mixpanel has been around longer, has more integrations, and has a larger team building features. If you need very specific capabilities that only Mixpanel offers, it might be worth the premium. But for most teams doing product analytics, OpenPanel covers the core use cases at a fraction of the cost.

You can see a more detailed comparison on our [Mixpanel alternative](/compare/mixpanel-alternative) page.

## Tips for Managing Mixpanel Costs

If you decide Mixpanel is the right tool for you, here are some ways to keep costs under control:

**Be intentional about what you track.** Don't track everything just because you can. Define your key metrics and the events that feed into them. You can always add more tracking later if you need it.

**Use the startup program if you qualify.** That free year gives you runway to grow before you need to worry about analytics costs.

**Consider annual billing.** Mixpanel typically offers 10-15% discounts for annual commitments. If you're confident you'll stick with the tool, this is easy savings.

**Audit your tracking regularly.** Over time, teams tend to accumulate tracking that's no longer used. Old features get deprecated, experiments end, but the events keep flowing. A quarterly audit can help you trim unnecessary events.

**Negotiate at renewal.** B2B SaaS pricing is often negotiable, especially at higher volumes. Don't just accept the renewal quote, ask what flexibility exists.

## Making the Decision

Mixpanel is a good product. The analytics are powerful, the UI is well-designed, and there's a reason it's one of the most popular tools in the category.

But pricing matters. If you're a growing startup watching your runway, or a bootstrapped company keeping costs lean, or an enterprise trying to justify spend to finance, you need to factor in the true cost of your analytics stack.

The questions to ask yourself:

1. How many events will you realistically track as you grow?
2. Do you need Group Analytics for B2B analysis?
3. Do you need data export to a warehouse?
4. What happens to your budget when your user base doubles?

If the answers to those questions make you nervous about Mixpanel's pricing trajectory, it might be worth looking at alternatives before you're locked in.

[OpenPanel](/) offers a 30-day free trial with no credit card required. You can try it alongside Mixpanel and see which fits better for your needs and budget. And if you want maximum control over costs and data, [self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting) is always an option.
