Product analytics tells you *what users do* inside your product — which features they use, where they drop off, how often they come back, and what paths they take before converting. It's the difference between knowing "we got 10,000 pageviews" and knowing "40% of users who start onboarding never finish step 3."

If you want those insights without sending user behavior data to a third party, self-hosted product analytics is the way to go.

But here's the problem: most self-hosted analytics tools only cover **web analytics** — pageviews, traffic sources, and referrals. Product analytics features like funnels, retention, cohorts, and user identification require a different class of tool.

We compared every self-hosted tool that offers real product analytics capabilities. Here's what's worth your time.

## What Makes Product Analytics Different from Web Analytics

Web analytics answers questions about your **website traffic**: where visitors come from, which pages they view, and how long they stay. Tools like [Plausible](/compare/plausible-alternative), [Umami](/compare/umami-alternative), and [GoatCounter](/compare/goatcounter-alternative) do this well.

Product analytics goes deeper. It answers questions about **user behavior**:

- **Funnels**: What percentage of users complete signup? Where exactly do they drop off?
- **Retention**: Are users coming back after their first week? First month?
- **User journeys**: What do users do before upgrading to a paid plan?
- **Cohort analysis**: Do users who onboard on mobile retain better than desktop users?
- **Event tracking**: Which features get used? How often? By whom?

If you're building a SaaS, mobile app, or any product where understanding user behavior matters, you need product analytics — not just pageview counts.

```

Runs on Docker Compose with ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, and Redis. A mid-range VPS (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) handles millions of events. The setup wizard handles configuration, database setup, and SSL.

Full guide: [How to self-host OpenPanel](/articles/how-to-self-host-openpanel) | [Self-hosting docs](/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting)

### Pricing

Self-hosting is free. All features included — the self-hosted version is identical to the cloud version with no feature gating.

Cloud plans start at $2.50/month (5,000 events) and scale to $90/month for 1 million events. Every tier includes every feature.

### Pros
- Full product analytics (funnels, retention, user profiles) plus web analytics in one tool
- Simplest self-hosting setup among tools with comparable features
- Cookieless tracking — no consent banners needed
- Self-hosted and cloud versions are identical
- Multiple SDKs: JavaScript, React, Next.js, Vue, React Native, Flutter, and more

### Cons
- Newer project — smaller community than PostHog or Matomo
- No built-in session replay or heatmaps yet
- No built-in feature flags or A/B testing

---

## PostHog

**Best for: Engineering teams that want analytics, feature flags, and experiments in one platform**

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is the most feature-rich self-hosted product analytics tool. It bundles product analytics with session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, surveys, and error tracking. If you want a Swiss Army knife for product development, PostHog is the most complete option.

![PostHog Dashboard](/content/tools/posthog.png)

### Product Analytics Features

## Mitzu

**Best for: Data teams that want product analytics on top of their existing data warehouse**

[Mitzu](https://www.mitzu.io/) takes a different approach. Instead of ingesting data into its own database, it runs analytics queries directly on your existing data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.). If you already have event data in a warehouse, Mitzu gives you product analytics without duplicating data.

### Product Analytics Features

- **Funnels**: Conversion funnel analysis running on your warehouse
- **Retention**: Cohort retention directly on warehouse data
- **Segmentation**: Filter users by any property in your warehouse
- **User journeys**: Path analysis on warehouse data
- **Revenue analytics**: Connect events to revenue data

### Deployment

Mitzu deploys as a web application that connects to your existing warehouse. Self-hosting is available but requires a paid license.

Requirements: An existing data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, ClickHouse, or PostgreSQL) with event data already flowing in.

### Pricing

Self-hosting requires a paid license (pricing available on request). Cloud plans are also custom-priced. There is no free tier for self-hosting.

### Pros
- No data duplication — queries your existing warehouse
- Works with the data infrastructure you already have
- Strong for data teams who live in SQL and warehouses
- Good for organizations with complex data pipelines

### Cons
- Requires an existing data warehouse with event data
- Self-hosting requires a paid license
- Not suitable for teams starting from scratch
- Smaller community and less documentation

## Self-Hosted Product Analytics vs Cloud: When to Self-Host

The case for self-hosting product analytics is even stronger than for web analytics. Product analytics involves **user-level data** — individual users, their behaviors, their journeys through your product. This data is more sensitive than aggregate pageview counts.

### Self-host product analytics when:

- **You handle sensitive user data.** Healthcare (HIPAA), finance, or any industry where user behavior data is regulated. Self-hosting eliminates third-party data transfers entirely. See our [compliance guide](/articles/better-compliance-self-hosted-analytics).
- **You need user-level data control.** Product analytics tracks individual users. Under GDPR, this is personal data. Self-hosting gives you full control over retention, deletion, and access.
- **You want cost predictability.** Cloud product analytics pricing scales with events and identified users. At scale, this gets expensive fast. Self-hosting costs are your server costs.
- **You have data residency requirements.** Some regulations require data to stay in specific geographic regions. Self-hosting on your own infrastructure solves this.

### Use cloud when:

- **You're just getting started with product analytics.** Cloud gets you insights faster. Self-host later when you've validated the tool fits your needs.
- **You don't have ops capacity.** Product analytics tools with ClickHouse backends need some database knowledge to maintain.
- **You need guaranteed uptime.** If analytics downtime directly impacts product decisions, a managed service with SLAs may be worth the cost.

With [OpenPanel](/pricing), you can start on Cloud and migrate to self-hosting at any time. The features are identical in both versions.

---

## How to Get Started

### 1. Pick a server

For self-hosted product analytics, you'll want slightly more resources than for basic web analytics since product analytics involves more complex queries (funnels, retention calculations).

Recommended starting point: 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 80 GB SSD. This handles most small-to-medium products comfortably.

- **[Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=7Hq0H5mQh7tM)** — A CX31 (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) for around €8.50/month
- **DigitalOcean** — Equivalent droplet for ~$48/month
- **Vultr** — Similar pricing to DigitalOcean

### 2. Install and configure

For OpenPanel:

```bash
git clone -b self-hosting https://github.com/Openpanel-dev/openpanel && cd openpanel/self-hosting && ./setup
./start
```

The setup wizard walks you through domain configuration, database setup, SSL, and worker settings. Full guide: [How to self-host OpenPanel](/articles/how-to-self-host-openpanel).

### 3. Instrument your product

Product analytics requires event tracking in your codebase. With OpenPanel, install the SDK for your framework:

```bash
npm install @openpanel/nextjs
# or @openpanel/react, @openpanel/vue, @openpanel/sdk
```

Then track events where they happen:

```typescript
import { op } from '@openpanel/nextjs';

// Track a custom event
op.track('signup_completed', {
  plan: 'pro',
  source: 'landing_page'
});

// Identify a user
op.identify({
  profileId: 'user_123',
  email: 'user@example.com',
  plan: 'pro'
});
```

See the [SDK documentation](/docs/get-started/install-openpanel) for your specific framework.

### 4. Build your first funnel

Once events are flowing, create your first conversion funnel. A common starting point: **Visit landing page > Sign up > Complete onboarding > First key action**. This immediately shows you where users drop off in your core flow.

<Faqs>
<FaqItem question="What is the best self-hosted product analytics tool?">
For most teams, OpenPanel offers the best balance of product analytics features, ease of self-hosting, and cost. PostHog is more feature-rich (session replay, feature flags) but significantly more complex to self-host. Countly is best for mobile-first products.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Can I self-host Mixpanel or Amplitude?">
No. Mixpanel and Amplitude are cloud-only platforms with no self-hosting option. The closest self-hosted alternatives are OpenPanel (most similar to Mixpanel in product analytics features) and PostHog (broader feature set with more complexity).
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="What is the difference between product analytics and web analytics?">
Web analytics tracks website traffic — pageviews, referrals, devices, and geographic data. Product analytics tracks user behavior — events, funnels, retention, cohorts, and user journeys. Most self-hosted tools only offer web analytics. OpenPanel, PostHog, and Countly offer both. See our [self-hosted web analytics comparison](/articles/self-hosted-web-analytics) for web-focused tools.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="How much does self-hosted product analytics cost?">
The software is free for OpenPanel (AGPL-3.0) and PostHog (MIT). Your cost is server infrastructure — typically $10-50/month for a VPS, depending on traffic. Countly's Enterprise features and Matomo's product analytics plugins require paid licenses on top of server costs.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Do I need separate tools for web and product analytics?">
Not necessarily. OpenPanel and PostHog both combine web analytics and product analytics in one platform. This means a single tracking snippet, one dashboard, and unified user profiles. If you only need web analytics, simpler tools like Plausible or Umami are better suited.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Is self-hosted product analytics GDPR compliant?">
Self-hosting is one of the strongest approaches for GDPR compliance because user data never leaves your infrastructure. Combined with cookieless tracking (available in OpenPanel), you can run product analytics without consent banners and with full control over data retention and deletion.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Can I start with cloud and migrate to self-hosting later?">
With OpenPanel, yes. The cloud and self-hosted versions are identical in features. You can start with Cloud to validate the tool and migrate to self-hosting when you're ready. PostHog also supports both, though there are some feature differences between their cloud and self-hosted versions.
