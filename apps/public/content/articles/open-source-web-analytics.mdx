In this comprehensive guide, we've evaluated 9 of the best open source web analytics tools available today. Each tool has been assessed based on features, pricing, ease of use, and community support.

While PostHog offers a broader range of features, OpenPanel stands out for its simplicity in self-hosting and provides the same capabilities whether you use the cloud or self-hosted version. Both platforms serve as robust product and web analytics tools, but OpenPanel's pricing and deployment flexibility make it especially appealing for teams seeking value and ease of use.
</FaqItem>
<FaqItem question="What tools can PostHog replace?">
