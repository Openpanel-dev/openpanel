    "title": "What are notification rules?",
    "text": "Notification rules are the **trigger layer** in OpenPanel. They define *when* something should happen - and **[integrations](/features/integrations)** define *where* it goes.\n\nA notification rule has three parts:\n\n1. **Events** - which events to watch for (e.g. `screen_view`, `purchase`, `signup`)\n2. **Filters** - optional property conditions that narrow the match (e.g. path starts with `/onboarding` and ends with `/verify`)\n3. **Integrations** - which connected services should receive the notification when the rule fires\n\nYou can also write a **template** using variables like `{{country}}`, `{{browser}}`, or any event property. The template is rendered with real values when the notification fires, so your Slack message or webhook payload contains the exact context you need.\n\nHere's a concrete example: you want to know when new users visit your onboarding verification page. You create a rule that:\n\n- Watches for `screen_view` events\n- Filters where **path** starts with `/onboarding` and ends with `/verify`\n- Uses the template *\"New user with their first event from {{country}}\"*\n- Routes to your Slack workspace and a webhook integration\n\nNow every time someone hits that page, your team sees a message in Slack with the user's country, and your webhook fires for any downstream automation.\n\nThe notifications page in OpenPanel shows a feed of every notification that fired - searchable, sortable by date, and showing the integration, country, OS, browser, and profile for each one. You can see exactly what happened and when.\n\nNotification rules are the glue between **events you track** and **actions you take**. Combined with integrations, they turn OpenPanel from a passive analytics tool into an active part of your workflow."

      {
        "question": "What's the difference between notifications and integrations?",
        "answer": "Integrations are connections to external services (Slack, Discord, webhooks). Notifications are rules that define when those integrations should fire. You create an integration once, then attach it to as many notification rules as you want."
      },
      {
        "question": "What template variables can I use?",
        "answer": "You can use any event property as a template variable with the {{property}} syntax. Common ones include {{country}}, {{city}}, {{browser}}, {{os}}, {{path}}, and any custom properties you send with your events."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I have multiple filters on a single rule?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can stack multiple property filters on a rule. All filters must match for the rule to fire - they work as AND conditions. For example, path starts with /onboarding AND path ends with /verify."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I send to multiple integrations from one rule?",
        "answer": "Yes. Attach as many integrations as you want to a single rule. When the rule fires, all attached integrations are triggered simultaneously. For example, send to both Slack and a webhook at the same time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a delay between the event and the notification?",
        "answer": "No. Notifications fire in real time as events arrive. There's no batching or delay - when an event matches a rule, the attached integrations are triggered immediately."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see past notifications?",
        "answer": "Yes. The Notifications tab shows a feed of every notification that fired. You can search, sort by date, and see details like the integration used, country, OS, browser, and profile for each notification."
