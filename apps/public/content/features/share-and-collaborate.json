    "text": "Share and collaborate in OpenPanel is how you **get the right data to the right people** without opening the door to everything.\n\n**Unlimited members** - There’s no cap on how many people you can invite. Add your whole team, contractors, or stakeholders and manage them from a single members view.\n\n**Flexible access** - Each member can have:\n\n- **Organization-wide access** - full visibility across all projects, ideal for admins and core team\n- **Fine-grained access** - access only to specific projects you choose, so stakeholders see only what’s relevant\n\n**What you can share** - You’re not limited to \"all or nothing\" views:\n\n- **Complete dashboards** - share an entire dashboard so others see the same layout and reports you use\n- **Individual reports** - share a single report (e.g. one funnel or one retention chart) for focused updates\n\n**How you share** - Every shared dashboard or report can be:\n\n- **Publicly available** - anyone with the link can view it (handy for status pages, exec summaries, or embedded views)\n- **Password-protected** - only people with the password can open the link, so you keep sensitive data under control\n\nInviting is straightforward: add members by email, assign access (org or specific projects), and optionally share dashboards or reports with public or password-protected links. Your team stays aligned on the same numbers without compromising security or clarity."

        "question": "What’s the difference between org-wide and project-level access?",
        "answer": "Org-wide access lets a member see and work with all projects in the organization. Project-level access restricts them to only the projects you assign - useful for clients, partners, or teams that only need a subset of your data."

      {
        "question": "Can I share just one report instead of a whole dashboard?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can share a complete dashboard or a single report (e.g. one funnel or one chart). The shared link shows only what you chose to share."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can shared links be password-protected?",
        "answer": "Yes. When you create a share link for a dashboard or report, you can leave it public (anyone with the link can view) or set a password so only people with the password can open it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I change a member’s access after they’ve joined?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can update a member’s access (add or remove projects, or switch to org-wide) or remove them from the organization at any time from the members area."
