    "title": "Why data visualization matters",
    "text": "Tracking events is step one. **Turning those events into charts and dashboards** is where decisions happen.\n\nProduct analytics dashboards let you see trends, spot problems, and measure experiments at a glance. Without visualization, you're staring at raw event logs. With it, you can answer questions like:\n\n- **Is signup conversion improving this month?** → Check the **funnel** chart\n- **Are users coming back after week one?** → Check the **retention** curve\n- **Where do users go after the pricing page?** → Check the **Sankey** diagram\n- **How are page load times distributed?** → Check the **histogram**\n- **Where are my users located?** → Check the **map** chart\n- **How does daily active usage trend?** → Check the **time series** chart\n\nOpenPanel gives you all of these chart types out of the box. Every chart is powered by the same events you already track-no extra instrumentation, no data pipelines, no SQL.\n\n### Chart types in OpenPanel\n\n- **Funnels** - Visualize step-by-step conversion. See exactly where users drop off in signup, onboarding, or purchase flows.\n- **Retention** - Measure how many users come back after day 1, week 1, month 1. Understand whether your product is sticky.\n- **Conversion** - Track goal completion rates over time. Compare conversion across segments, campaigns, or product changes.\n- **Sankey diagrams** - Map user journeys visually. See every path users take through your product and where they branch or exit.\n- **Maps** - See where your users are, geographically. Understand regional adoption and plan localization.\n- **Time series** - Plot any metric over time. Track daily active users, event volume, revenue, or any custom metric with flexible date ranges.\n- **Histograms** - Understand distributions. How long do sessions last? How many actions do users take? See the full shape of your data.\n\nYou can combine these charts into **dashboards** that update in real time. Pin the reports that matter, share them with your team, and check them daily-no waiting for a weekly report email."

      {
        "question": "Do I need to write SQL to build charts?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I share dashboards with my team?",
        "answer": "Yes. Dashboards are accessible to your team members. Pin charts, arrange them however you like, and everyone sees the same real-time data."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often do charts update?",
        "answer": "Charts update in real time as new events arrive. There's no overnight processing or batch delay-data appears within seconds of being tracked."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a Sankey diagram?",
        "answer": "A Sankey diagram is a flow visualization that shows how users move through your product. Each path is drawn as a flow between steps, so you can see common journeys, unexpected branches, and exit points at a glance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use retention and funnel charts together?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can build funnels to find where users drop off and retention charts to see if the users who do convert come back. Combining both gives you a complete picture of activation and engagement."
