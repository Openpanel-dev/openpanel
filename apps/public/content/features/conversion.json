    "title": "What is conversion tracking?",
    "text": "Conversion tracking measures the rate at which users complete a desired action-like going from `session_start` to `save_recipe`, or from `signup` to `purchase`. You define a **flow** (a start event and an end event), and OpenPanel calculates the conversion rate for every time period you choose.\n\nIf you're familiar with [funnels](/features/funnels), conversions will feel similar. Both measure whether users complete a sequence. The difference is **perspective**:\n\n- **Funnels** are great for understanding *where* users drop off in a multi-step flow. They answer: \"which step loses the most users?\"\n- **Conversions** are great for understanding *trends*. They answer: \"is our conversion getting better or worse over time?\"\n\nWith conversion tracking, you get:\n\n- **Conversion rate over time** - see how your rate trends week over week or day by day. Spot improvements from product changes or regressions from bugs\n- **Average, best, and worst rates** - instantly see your overall average and the specific time periods where conversion peaked or dipped\n- **Breakdowns** - split conversion by any property (device, country, variant, campaign) to compare segments side by side. This is especially powerful for **A/B testing**: break down by experiment variant and see which one converts better, with per-period granularity\n- **Total conversions** - not just rates but absolute numbers, so you understand volume alongside percentage\n\nConversion reports in OpenPanel are built on the same events you already track. Define a flow once, and you get a live, updating chart that shows whether your product is converting more or fewer users over time.\n\nNo sampling, no delayed processing. Every event counts, and results update in real time."

        "question": "How is this different from funnels?",
        "answer": "Funnels show you a multi-step sequence and where users drop off at each step. Conversions focus on a single flow (start → goal) and show you how the conversion rate changes over time. Use funnels to diagnose where users get stuck; use conversions to monitor whether things are getting better or worse."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use conversions for A/B testing?",
        "answer": "Yes. Add a breakdown by your experiment variant property, and you'll see each variant's conversion rate plotted over time with per-period detail. This gives you richer insight than a single aggregate number-you can see if one variant's advantage holds consistently or fluctuates."
      },
      {
        "question": "What events can I use?",
        "answer": "Any events you already track. A conversion is defined by two events: a start event and a goal event. Common examples include session_start → signup, signup → purchase, or page_view → add_to_cart."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the data sampled?",
        "answer": "No. OpenPanel processes every event with no sampling. Your conversion rates are calculated from complete data, so you can trust the numbers even for small segments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see absolute numbers alongside rates?",
        "answer": "Yes. Every conversion report shows both the conversion rate and the total number of conversions. The detail table below the chart includes totals and per-period counts for each segment."
