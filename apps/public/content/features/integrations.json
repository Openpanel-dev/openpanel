    "text": "Integrations are the bridge between OpenPanel and everything else. They let you **get data out** of OpenPanel and into the tools and workflows your team already relies on.\n\nThe idea is simple: you create an **integration** (a connection to an external service), then attach it to a **[notification rule](/features/notifications)** that fires whenever the conditions you define are met. That's it - OpenPanel handles the rest.\n\nHere's an example: you want to be notified in Slack whenever a new user signs up from a specific country. You create a Slack integration, set up a notification rule that triggers on `signup` events, and use a template like *\"New user from {{country}}\"*. Every time someone signs up, the message lands in your Slack channel - no polling, no cron jobs, no glue code.\n\nBut it goes further than alerts. With **webhooks**, you can push event data to any URL - including **Zapier**, **Make**, or your own backend. That means you can trigger custom workflows based on real user behavior: send a welcome email when someone completes onboarding, notify sales when a user hits a usage milestone, or log high-value events to an external system.\n\nYou can even trigger integrations when a user completes a **funnel** - combining OpenPanel's funnel analysis with real-time action.\n\nToday, OpenPanel supports:\n\n- **Slack** - post messages to any channel when events fire\n- **Discord** - same as Slack, but for Discord servers\n- **Webhooks** - send event payloads to any URL with custom headers and a JavaScript transform for full control over the payload shape\n\nComing soon:\n\n- **S3-compatible storage** - automatically export events to Amazon S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, or any S3-compatible store\n- **Google Cloud Storage** - export to GCS for easy import into **BigQuery**, **Redshift**, or your data warehouse\n\nThese storage integrations will make importing your OpenPanel events into your data warehouse straightforward and easy - no custom ETL pipelines needed."

      {
        "question": "How do integrations and notifications work together?",
        "answer": "Integrations are the destinations (Slack channel, webhook URL, Discord server). Notification rules are the triggers (when event X happens with filter Y). You create both, then attach integrations to rules. When a rule fires, all attached integrations receive the data."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use webhooks with Zapier?",
        "answer": "Yes. Create a webhook integration pointing to your Zapier webhook URL. You can use the JavaScript transform to shape the payload into whatever format your Zap expects. This lets you trigger any Zapier workflow based on real user events in OpenPanel."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the JavaScript transform do?",
        "answer": "The JavaScript transform is a function that receives the raw event payload and returns a modified version. You can rename fields, filter out properties, add computed values, or completely restructure the data. It runs before the payload is sent to the webhook URL."
      },
      {
        "question": "When will S3 and GCS integrations be available?",
        "answer": "S3-compatible storage and Google Cloud Storage integrations are on the near-term roadmap. These will let you automatically export events for import into BigQuery, Redshift, or any data warehouse without building custom ETL pipelines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can one integration be used by multiple notification rules?",
        "answer": "Yes. An integration is just a connection to a service. You can attach it to as many notification rules as you want. For example, a single Slack integration can be triggered by rules for signups, purchases, and errors - each with its own template and filters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a limit to how many integrations I can create?",
        "answer": "There's no hard limit. Create as many integrations and notification rules as you need to cover your workflows."
