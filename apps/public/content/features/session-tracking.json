    "title": "What is session tracking?",
    "text": "A session is the **window of activity** between a user arriving on your site and leaving. It starts with an entry page, includes every page view and event along the way, and ends when the user goes idle or closes the tab.\n\nMost analytics tools either give you **too little** (aggregated page-view counts with no sense of flow) or **too much** (full session recordings that can be slow to review). OpenPanel gives you both options:\n\n- **Session tracking** (always on) — a structured timeline of what happened in each session: pages visited, events fired, duration, referrer, and device context\n- **[Session replay](/features/session-replay)** (opt-in) — a playable recording of the session built on [rrweb](https://www.rrweb.io/), so you can see exactly what the user clicked and where they got confused\n\nFor every session, OpenPanel captures:\n\n- **Entry page and exit page** - where the user started and where they left\n- **Pages visited in order** - the path through your site or app\n- **Events fired** - signups, clicks, feature usage, or any custom event\n- **Session duration** - how long the session lasted\n- **Referrer and UTM parameters** - how the user got there\n- **Device, browser, and location** - context without fingerprinting\n\nThis means you can answer questions like:\n\n- **What pages do users visit before signing up?**\n- **Do users from organic search behave differently than paid traffic?**\n- **How long are sessions for users who convert vs. those who don't?**\n\nSession replay is **opt-in and off by default**. When disabled, the replay script is never loaded and adds no overhead. When enabled, it loads asynchronously as a separate script so your main analytics bundle stays lean.\n\nSessions in OpenPanel connect directly to **events and user profiles**. Every event belongs to a session, and every session belongs to a user. This means funnels, retention, and user timelines all have session context built in."

        "question": "Does OpenPanel have session replay?",
        "answer": "Yes. Session replay is available as an opt-in feature. Enable it by setting `sessionReplay: { enabled: true }` in your init config. When disabled, the replay script is never loaded. See the [session replay docs](/docs/session-replay) for setup and privacy options."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to set up session tracking separately?",
        "answer": "No. Sessions are created automatically from the events and page views you already send. There's no separate session SDK or configuration step."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does OpenPanel define a session?",
        "answer": "A session starts when a user triggers their first event and ends after 30 minutes of inactivity. If the user returns after the timeout, a new session begins. This is consistent with how most analytics tools define sessions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see individual user sessions?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can view a user's session history, including the pages they visited and events they triggered in each session. This is available in the user profile view. If session replay is enabled, you can also play back the session."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does session tracking require cookies?",
        "answer": "No. OpenPanel can run without cookies. Sessions can be tracked using a lightweight session identifier that doesn't require cookie consent. If you enable first-party cookies, session continuity improves but it's not required."
