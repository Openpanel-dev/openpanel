    "title": "What retention means",
    "text": "**Retention** is the share of users who come back after doing something once. It answers: *Of the people who did X in a given week, how many did Y later?*\n\nThat’s it. No session thresholds, no arbitrary “active” definitions-just a clear picture of **who sticks** and who doesn’t.\n\nWhy does it matter? Because retention is **product truth**. Traffic and signups can look great while the product fails to stick. Retention cuts through that. It tells you:\n\n- **Whether your product is habit-forming** - Do users return after the first use?\n- **When churn happens** - Do they leave after day 1, week 1, or month 1?\n- **Which segments stick** - Do certain cohorts (e.g. by plan, source, or feature) retain better?\n\nIn OpenPanel, retention is built on your **events**. You choose an initial event (e.g. `signup_completed`, `first_purchase`) and a return event (e.g. `feature_used`, `session_started`). OpenPanel groups users into cohorts by when they did the initial event and shows what percentage did the return event in subsequent periods. No extra instrumentation-the same events that power funnels and user profiles power retention."

        "question": "Can I use any events for retention?",
        "answer": "Yes. You choose an initial event (e.g. signup_completed, first_purchase) and a return event (e.g. session_started, feature_used). OpenPanel cohorts users by when they did the initial event and shows what percentage did the return event in later periods."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if my retention is good?",
        "answer": "There’s no universal benchmark-it depends on your product and cohort. What matters is trend and segment comparison: improving over time and understanding which cohorts retain better. Retention gives you the numbers; you decide what “good” is for your product."
