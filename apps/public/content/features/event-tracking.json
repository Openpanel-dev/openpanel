    "title": "What is event tracking?",
    "text": "Event tracking is the **foundation of product analytics**. Instead of relying on page-view counts or session timers, you capture discrete actions-clicks, page views, signups, purchases-as structured events with properties.\n\nEvery meaningful interaction becomes a data point you can query, filter, and visualize. This is how modern product teams answer questions like:\n\n- **How many users completed onboarding this week?**\n- **Which features do paying customers use most?**\n- **Where in the signup flow do users drop off?**\n\nTraditional analytics tools (like Google Analytics) are built around sessions and page views. That works for marketing, but it falls short when you need to understand **product behavior**: what users do *inside* your app, how they progress through flows, and what correlates with retention.\n\nOpenPanel takes a different approach. You send events from your app or website using a lightweight SDK or API. Each event has a name (e.g. `signup_completed`, `feature_used`) and optional properties (e.g. `plan: pro`, `source: google`). OpenPanel stores these events and lets you build **funnels**, **retention charts**, and **user profiles** on top of them-without the complexity of enterprise analytics tools.\n\nBecause OpenPanel is **privacy-first**, you can run it without cookies and without sending personal data to third parties. Self-host it or use our cloud-your data stays yours."

        "question": "Do I need cookies for event tracking?",

      {
        "question": "How is this different from Google Analytics?",
        "answer": "Google Analytics is built for marketing and traffic analysis, with a complex data model. OpenPanel is built for product and conversion: simple events that map directly to user actions. You get funnels, retention, and user profiles without the GA learning curve."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track custom events?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can send any event name and attach optional properties (e.g. plan, value, feature_name). Custom events work in funnels, retention, and user profiles the same way as built-in events."
