    "title": "What is user identification?",
    "text": "User identification connects anonymous activity to a **known user profile**. Instead of treating every visit as a nameless session, you link events, page views, and sessions to a real person-someone you can look up, follow over time, and understand in context.\n\nWith OpenPanel, identification works like this:\n\n1. A visitor arrives and generates anonymous events\n2. When they sign up or log in, you call `identify()` with an ID and optional properties\n3. OpenPanel merges their anonymous history with the identified profile\n\nFrom that point on, you have a **complete picture**: when they first appeared, when they were last active, every event they triggered, and any properties you attached (plan, company, role, etc.).\n\nThis is how modern product teams answer questions like:\n\n- **When did this user first show up, and what led them to sign up?**\n- **What did they do in the last 7 days?**\n- **Which features does this account actually use?**\n- **Is this user at risk of churning?**\n\nUnlike traditional analytics that reduce users to anonymous metrics, OpenPanel gives you **individual-level visibility** without compromising privacy. You control what data you send. No third-party cookies, no fingerprinting, no data sold to advertisers. You get user profiles that help your support, sales, and product teams-without the surveillance."

      },
      {
        "question": "Is this GDPR-compliant?",
        "answer": "Yes. You control exactly what data you send. OpenPanel doesn't add tracking pixels, fingerprinting, or third-party cookies. If you self-host, no data ever leaves your infrastructure. You can also delete a user's data at any time to comply with erasure requests."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from Google Analytics user tracking?",
        "answer": "Google Analytics relies on anonymous client IDs and has limited support for individual-level profiles. OpenPanel gives you a dedicated profile page per user with a full event timeline, session history, and custom properties-without sending data to Google."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I attach custom properties to users?",
        "answer": "Yes. Pass any key-value pairs when you call identify()-plan, company, role, revenue, or anything else. These properties are searchable and can be used to filter and segment users across all reports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to identify every user?",
        "answer": "No. Identification is optional. Anonymous users still generate events and sessions. You identify users when you want to link their activity to a known person-typically after login or signup."
