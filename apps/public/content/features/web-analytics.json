    "text": "OpenPanel web analytics gives you a **complete website analytics dashboard** the moment you add our tracking script. No goals to configure, no views to set up, no filters to define - everything works out of the box.\n\nHere's what you get immediately:\n\n- **Key metrics at a glance** - unique visitors, sessions, pageviews, pages per session, bounce rate, and session duration. Each metric has a sparkline showing the trend and percentage change vs. the previous period\n- **Traffic sources** - see where your visitors come from. Top referrers, search engines, social networks, and direct traffic are broken down automatically\n- **UTM campaign tracking** - every UTM parameter (source, medium, campaign, term, content) gets its own breakdown so you can measure marketing campaigns without any extra setup\n- **Popular pages, entries, and exits** - know which pages get the most views, which pages visitors land on first, and which pages they leave from\n- **Device breakdown** - browser, browser version, OS, OS version, device brand, and device model. See exactly what your visitors use\n- **Geographic details** - a country table with flags and visitor counts alongside an interactive map. Drill into regions and cities\n- **User journey** - follow the path visitors take through your site, from landing page through navigation to exit\n- **Insights** - AI-powered highlights that surface the biggest changes and anomalies in your traffic so you can act on what matters\n\nThe most powerful part: **every value in the dashboard is clickable**. See a referrer you want to investigate? Click it to filter the entire dashboard by that referrer. Curious about mobile traffic from Germany? Click the country, click the device - the whole view updates instantly. No query builder, no SQL, no waiting.\n\nOpenPanel is **privacy-first**. We don't use third-party cookies, we don't sell your data, and we don't slow down your site. You can self-host or use our cloud - your data stays yours."

      {
        "question": "What do I need to set up?",
        "answer": "Just add our tracking script to your website. That's it. Page views, sessions, referrers, UTMs, device data, and geo are all captured automatically. There are no goals to configure, no views to create, and no filters to define."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from Google Analytics?",
        "answer": "Google Analytics requires significant configuration - goals, views, filters, consent banners, and a steep learning curve. OpenPanel gives you a complete, beautiful dashboard from a single script tag. Everything is clickable, privacy-first, and works without cookies. You can self-host it or use our cloud."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a cookie consent banner?",
        "answer": "No. OpenPanel is designed to be privacy-first. We don't use third-party cookies and we don't track personal data. Many teams run OpenPanel without any consent banner at all. Check your local regulations, but in most cases you're covered."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I filter by multiple properties at once?",
        "answer": "Yes. Click any value to filter the dashboard - then click another value to add a second filter. You can stack as many filters as you want. For example, click a country, then a browser, then a referrer to see exactly that slice of traffic."
      },
      {
        "question": "What UTM parameters are supported?",
        "answer": "All five standard UTM parameters: source, medium, campaign, term, and content. They're captured automatically from the URL - no extra configuration needed. Each parameter gets its own breakdown in the dashboard."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the tracking script slow down my site?",
        "answer": "No. The OpenPanel script is lightweight (under 5 KB) and loads asynchronously. It won't block rendering or affect your Core Web Vitals scores."
      },
      {
        "question": "What geographic data is available?",
        "answer": "You get country-level breakdown with flags, an interactive world map, and the ability to drill into regions and cities. All geo data is derived from the visitor's IP at ingestion time - nothing is stored or sent to third parties."
