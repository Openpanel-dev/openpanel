# How to add analytics to Nuxt

This guide walks you through adding OpenPanel to a Nuxt 3 application. The official `@openpanel/nuxt` module makes integration effortless with auto-imported composables, automatic page view tracking, and a built-in proxy option to bypass ad blockers.

OpenPanel is an open-source alternative to Mixpanel and Google Analytics. It uses cookieless tracking by default, so you won't need cookie consent banners for basic analytics.

## Prerequisites

- A Nuxt 3 project
- An OpenPanel account ([sign up free](https://dashboard.openpanel.dev/onboarding))
- Your Client ID from the OpenPanel dashboard

## Install the module [#install]

Start by installing the OpenPanel Nuxt module. This package includes everything you need for client-side tracking, including the auto-imported `useOpenPanel` composable.

```bash
npm install @openpanel/nuxt
```

If you prefer pnpm or yarn, those work too.

## Configure the module [#setup]

Add the module to your `nuxt.config.ts` and configure it with your Client ID. The module automatically sets up page view tracking and makes the `useOpenPanel` composable available throughout your app.

```ts title="nuxt.config.ts"
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@openpanel/nuxt'],
  openpanel: {
    clientId: 'your-client-id',
    trackScreenViews: true,
    trackOutgoingLinks: true,
    trackAttributes: true,
  },
});
```

That's it. Page views are now being tracked automatically as users navigate your app.

### Configuration options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `clientId` | — | Your OpenPanel client ID (required) |
| `apiUrl` | `https://api.openpanel.dev` | The API URL to send events to |
| `trackScreenViews` | `true` | Automatically track page views |
| `trackOutgoingLinks` | `true` | Track clicks on external links |
| `trackAttributes` | `true` | Track elements with `data-track` attributes |
| `trackHashChanges` | `false` | Track hash changes in URL |
| `disabled` | `false` | Disable all tracking |
| `proxy` | `false` | Route events through your server |

### Using environment variables

For production applications, store your Client ID in environment variables.

```ts title="nuxt.config.ts"
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@openpanel/nuxt'],
  openpanel: {
    clientId: process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_OPENPANEL_CLIENT_ID,
    trackScreenViews: true,
  },
});
```

```bash title=".env"
NUXT_PUBLIC_OPENPANEL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
```

## Track custom events [#events]

Page views only tell part of the story. To understand how users interact with your product, track custom events like button clicks, form submissions, or feature usage.

### Using the composable

The `useOpenPanel` composable is auto-imported, so you can use it directly in any component without importing anything.

```vue title="components/SignupButton.vue"
<script setup>
const op = useOpenPanel();

function handleClick() {
  op.track('button_clicked', {
    button_name: 'signup',
    button_location: 'hero',
  });
}
</script>

<template>
  <button type="button" @click="handleClick">Sign Up</button>
</template>
```

### Accessing via useNuxtApp

You can also access the OpenPanel instance through `useNuxtApp()` if you prefer.

```vue
<script setup>
const { $openpanel } = useNuxtApp();

$openpanel.track('my_event', { foo: 'bar' });
</script>
```

### Track form submissions

Form tracking helps you understand [conversion rates](/features/conversion) and identify where users drop off.

```vue title="components/ContactForm.vue"
<script setup>
const op = useOpenPanel();
const email = ref('');

async function handleSubmit() {
  op.track('form_submitted', {
    form_name: 'contact',
    form_location: 'homepage',
  });
  
  // Your form submission logic
}
</script>

<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="handleSubmit">
    <input v-model="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>
```

### Use data attributes for declarative tracking

The SDK supports declarative tracking using `data-track` attributes. This is useful for simple click tracking without writing JavaScript.

```vue
<template>
  <button
    data-track="button_clicked"
    data-track-button_name="signup"
    data-track-button_location="hero"
  >
    Sign Up
  </button>
</template>
```

When a user clicks this button, OpenPanel automatically sends a `button_clicked` event with the specified properties. This requires `trackAttributes: true` in your configuration.

## Identify users [#identify]

Anonymous tracking is useful, but identifying users unlocks more valuable insights. You can track behavior across sessions, segment users by properties, and build cohort analyses.

Call `identify` after a user logs in or when you have their information available.

```vue title="components/UserProfile.vue"
<script setup>
const op = useOpenPanel();
const props = defineProps(['user']);

watch(() => props.user, (user) => {
  if (user) {
    op.identify({
      profileId: user.id,
      firstName: user.firstName,
      lastName: user.lastName,
      email: user.email,
      properties: {
        plan: user.plan,
        signupDate: user.createdAt,
      },
    });
  }
}, { immediate: true });
</script>

<template>
  <div>Welcome, {{ user?.firstName }}!</div>
</template>
```

### Set global properties

Properties set with `setGlobalProperties` are included with every event. This is useful for app version tracking, feature flags, or A/B test variants.

```vue title="app.vue"
<script setup>
const op = useOpenPanel();

onMounted(() => {
  op.setGlobalProperties({
    app_version: '1.0.0',
    environment: useRuntimeConfig().public.environment,
  });
});
</script>
```

### Clear user data on logout

When users log out, clear the stored profile data to ensure subsequent events aren't associated with the previous user.

```vue title="components/LogoutButton.vue"
<script setup>
const op = useOpenPanel();

function handleLogout() {
  op.clear();
  navigateTo('/login');
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="handleLogout">Logout</button>
</template>
```

## Set up server-side tracking [#server]

For tracking events in server routes, API endpoints, or server middleware, use the `@openpanel/sdk` package. Server-side tracking requires a client secret for authentication.

### Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @openpanel/sdk
```

### Create a server instance

```ts title="server/utils/op.ts"
import { OpenPanel } from '@openpanel/sdk';

export const op = new OpenPanel({
  clientId: process.env.OPENPANEL_CLIENT_ID!,
  clientSecret: process.env.OPENPANEL_CLIENT_SECRET!,
});
```

### Track events in server routes

```ts title="server/api/webhook.post.ts"
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const body = await readBody(event);
  
  await op.track('webhook_received', {
    source: body.source,
    event_type: body.type,
  });
  
  return { success: true };
});
```

Never expose your client secret on the client side. Keep it in server-only code.

### Awaiting in serverless environments

If you're deploying to a serverless platform like Vercel or Netlify, make sure to await the tracking call to ensure it completes before the function terminates.

```ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  // Always await in serverless environments
  await op.track('my_server_event', { foo: 'bar' });
  return { message: 'Event logged!' };
});
```

## Bypass ad blockers with proxy [#proxy]

Many ad blockers block requests to third-party analytics domains. The Nuxt module includes a built-in proxy that routes events through your own server.

Enable the proxy option in your configuration:

```ts title="nuxt.config.ts"
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@openpanel/nuxt'],
  openpanel: {
    clientId: 'your-client-id',
    proxy: true, // Routes events through /api/openpanel/*
  },
});
```

When `proxy: true` is set:
- The module automatically sets `apiUrl` to `/api/openpanel`
- A server handler is registered at `/api/openpanel/**`
- All tracking requests route through your Nuxt server

This makes tracking requests invisible to browser extensions that block third-party analytics.

## Verify your setup [#verify]

Open your Nuxt app in the browser and navigate between a few pages. Interact with elements that trigger custom events. Then open your [OpenPanel dashboard](https://dashboard.openpanel.dev) and check the Real-time view to see events appearing within seconds.

If events aren't showing up, check the browser console for errors. The most common issues are:
- Incorrect client ID
- Ad blockers intercepting requests (enable the proxy option)
- Client ID exposed in server-only code

The Network tab in your browser's developer tools can help you confirm that requests are being sent.
