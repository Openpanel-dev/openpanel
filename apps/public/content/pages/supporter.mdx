TL;DR [**Become a supporter ðŸ«¶**](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_Az1CruNFzQB2bYdMOZmGHqTevW317knWqV44W1FqZmV)

First off, we want to say a massive thank you for even considering supporting OpenPanel. As an open-source project, every single supporter means the world to us. We're not a big corporation â€“ just a small team passionate about building something useful for the developer community.

OpenPanel started because we believed monitoring and observability tools shouldn't be complicated or locked behind expensive enterprise subscriptions. We wanted to create something that developers could actually use, modify, and run themselves. That's why we made it open-source â€“ it's not just about the code being free, it's about building something together with the community.

If you're using OpenPanel self-hosted and decide to become a supporter, you're helping us keep this project alive and kicking. Your support means we can spend more time fixing bugs, adding features, and improving documentation. It's as simple as that. No corporate speak, no fancy promises â€“ just honest work on making OpenPanel better for everyone.

Every contribution, no matter the size, helps us stay independent and focused on what matters: building a tool that actually helps developers in their daily work.
