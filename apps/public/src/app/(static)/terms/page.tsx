        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <h3>Subscription period</h3>
        <p>
          The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a
          paid Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually), depending
          on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the
          Subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew
          under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company
          cancels it.
        </p>
        <h3>Subscription cancellations</h3>
        <p>
          You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account
          settings page or by contacting the Company. You will not receive a
          refund for the fees You already paid for Your current Subscription
          period and You will be able to access the Service until the end of
          Your current Subscription period.
        </p>
        <h3>Billing</h3>
        <p>
          You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing
          information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone
          number, and a valid payment method information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company
          will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
          manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
          corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>
        <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
        <p>
          The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
          Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective
          at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any
          change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate
          Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
          comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified
          Subscription fee amount.
        </p>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are
          non-refundable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the
          Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of
          the Company.
        </p>
        <h3>Free Trial</h3>
        <p>
          The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a
          Free Trial for a limited period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to sign
          up for the Free Trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free
          Trial, You will not be charged by the Company until the Free Trial has
          expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless You canceled
          Your Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable
          Subscription fees for the type of Subscription You have selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any time and without notice, the Company reserves the right to (i)
          modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii)
          cancel such Free Trial offer.

          USD if You haven&apos;t purchased anything through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
          the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,

          advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
          fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
          limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
          means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these
          states, each party&apos;s liability will be limited to the greatest
          extent permitted by law.
        </p>

          company&apos;s provider makes any representation or warranty of any
          kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of
          the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
          included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or

          not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
          set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law.
