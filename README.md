## Disclaimer

> Hey folks 👋🏻 Just a friendly heads-up: we're still in the early stages of this project. We have migrated from pages to app dir and made some major changes during the development of Openpanel, so everything is not perfect.

## Stack

- **Nextjs** - the dashboard
- **Fastify** - event api
- **Postgres** - storing basic information
- **Clickhouse** - storing events
- **Redis** - cache layer, pub/sub and queue

### More

- Tailwind
- Shadcn
- tRPC - will probably migrate this to server actions
- Clerk - for authentication

## Self-hosting

OpenPanel can be self-hosted and we have tried to make it as simple as possible.
